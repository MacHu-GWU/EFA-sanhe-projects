Such a warning is the most serious of its kind that the FDA can have placed on a medication and indicates an increased risk of injury or even death. Although the makers of Strattera claimed that there were no instances of suicide or suicidal behavior, reports of suicidal thinking were such that it prompted this very serious advisement from the FDA.</li><li>Strattera has also been found to be a culprit in (though rare instances) very serious side effects such as heart attack or stroke. If you experience chest/jaw/left arm pain, sudden severe headache, weakness on one side of the body, confusion, slurred speech or a sudden change in vision, it is advised that you seek medical attention as soon as possible.</li><li>Strattera side effects have in some (again, rare) instances included hepatic (liver) impairment. Symptoms of this serious medical issue include yellowing of the skin or eyes, dark urine, stomach pains, and flu-like symptoms.  Because of this increased risk of liver dysfunction, you should never drink alcohol with Strattera or take the medication if you have a family history of liver problems. If you have experienced any of these Strattera side effects, you should see a doctor immediately.</li><li>Strattera may also cause seizures in patients with a personal or family history of the disorder, so be sure to tell your doctor if this applies to you.  Also, if you have any questions about how this medication may affect you, or if you have had suicidal tendencies in the past, you are greatly encouraged to divulge this information to your healthcare provider before beginning treatment with Strattera in order to prevent serious or life-threatening injury.</li></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Strattera Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/strattera-84x84.jpg?1df917" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Strattera" title="Strattera" pagespeed_url_hash="1854012789" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></div><p>Strattera | atomoxetine hcl is a drug manufactured by Lilly USA, LLC, approved for the treatment of the symptoms of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/complete-index.shtml">Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>.</p><p>Strattera is the first non-stimulant medication indicated for use in the treatment of ADHD by the FDA for adults and children ages 6 and older and works by selectively blocking reuptake of the chemical norepinephrine (a neurotransmitter) in the brain. This is thought to result in an increased ability to concentrate and a reduction in impulsivity and fidgeting in children and adults. The FDA has not approved Strattera for use in depression, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/anxiety/article_em.htm#Anxiety Overview">panic/anxiety</a>, or bipolar depression though these have been common off-label uses of the drug.</p><h2>Strattera dosing</h2><p>There are many things you and your doctor must consider before choosing your dose of Strattera.
