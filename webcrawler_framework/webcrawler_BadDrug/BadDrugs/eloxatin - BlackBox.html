Eloxatin is commonly <strong>used during chemotherapy</strong> in combination with other cancer fighting medicines such as <a title="leucovorin" href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/leucovorin-calcium-injection" target="_blank">leucovorin</a> to maximize benefits.</p><p><strong>Eloxatin</strong> may be used in patients who are undergoing <strong>surgery</strong> to remove a <strong>colon cancer tumor</strong>, and <strong>preventing the cancer from spreading </strong>any further.</p><h2>How Does Eloxatin Work?</h2><p><strong>Cancerous</strong> <strong>cells</strong> use <strong>DNA</strong> to <strong>grow</strong> and <strong>spread</strong> throughout the body. Eloxatin <strong>prevents</strong> this from happening by binding cells together, <strong>destroying</strong> the DNA, and <strong>stopping</strong> the multiplication of these cells.  Eloxatin can also affect blood cells in a similar way and slows reproduction of these vital cells.</p><p>Consequently <strong>blood tests</strong> may need to be taken to ensure <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>healthiness</strong> among patients.</p><h2>How is Eloxatin Given?</h2><p>Eloxatin comes in a powder and liquid form for<strong> intravenous injection</strong> administered by a doctor or nurse who has experience in the chemotherapeutic field. <strong>Infusional 5-fluorouracil</strong> or <strong><a title="leucoverin" href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/leucovorin-calcium-injection" target="_blank">leucovorin</a> </strong>is commonly given during treatment with Eloxatin. Typically, patients are injected with Eloxatin once every<strong> two weeks</strong>.
