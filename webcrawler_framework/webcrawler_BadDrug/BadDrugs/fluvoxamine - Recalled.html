Fluvoxamine has been found to be 8 times more likely to be associated with violence in patients than other medications. <br> <br> Risks of any suicidal thoughts in all patients are increased in those with a <strong>family history of bipolar disorder or mania</strong>. <br> <br> <br><h2>Other warnings</h2> <br> Patients should discuss with their doctor if the benefits of Fluvoxamine outweigh the risks of suicidal tendencies and worsening depression, especially those under the age of 25. <strong>A physician will readily test patients for at least 12 weeks</strong> after beginning Fluvoxamine. <br> <br> Those who were taking Fluvoxamine for 5-36 weeks <strong>will experience withdrawal reactions</strong> after discontinuing the drug. These reactions may continue for 12-21 days, and should be relieved within 1 day of retaking Fluvoxamine. <br> <br> Fluvoxamine may cause <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong>, especially mixed with particular drugs. (See contraindications) <br> <br> <strong>Before beginning the medication</strong>, patients should make aware any history of bipolar or manic-depressive disorders, suicide attempts, liver problems, history of seizures, low sodium intake (electrolyte imbalance), ulcers or bleeding problems, history of blood clotting disorders, kidney disease, history of heart disease or high blood pressure or history of strokes as all may cause complications when mixed with Fluvoxamine. <br> <br> <strong>Those who are allergic to Fluvoxamine or any of its ingredients</strong> (fluvoxamine maleate, carnauba wax, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, pregelatinized starch, silicon dioxide, sodium stearyl fumarate, corn starch, titanium dioxide and synthetic iron oxide) <strong>should NOT take this drug</strong>. <br> <br> <strong>Drinking alcohol</strong> with Fluvoxamine can increase the effects of the drug. <br> <br> Patients are advised to <strong>not operate heavy machinery</strong> until they are aware of how it will affect them as it can impair thinking. <br> <br> <strong>Older patients can be extra sensitive</strong> to the side effects of Fluvoxamine, like excessive bleeding. They can develop a severe mineral (electrolyte) imbalance, especially when this drug is paired with diuretics. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Contraindications:</strong> <br> Contraindications include diuretics, lithium, clopidogrel, methadone, omeprazole, St. John's wort, tacrine, tramadol, tryptophan, theophylline, warfarin, other antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine), heart and blood pressure medications, migraine medications, chlorpromazine, clozapine, haloperidol, perphenzine, sedatives, and seizure medications. <br> <br> Alosetron, amelteon, tizanidine, thioridazine, pimozide, MAOI's (for up to 14 days before or after taking Fluvoxamine) like furazolidone, methylene blue, mocolobemide, procarbazine, linezolid, risocarboxazid, phenelzine, ragagiline, selegiline and tranylcypromine are also contraindicated. <br> <br> Patients should be advised that alprazoam, trizolam, alosetron, ibuprofen, visapride, beta-blockers, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, methadone, melatonin, ramelteon, tacrine, dextromethorphan, sibutramine, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, sleep or anxiety drugs, narcotic pain relievers, paroxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, large amounts of caffeine and cigarettes all increase the risks associated with this drug. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Family Planning:</strong> <br> Fluvoxamine has been known to <strong>cause heart defects and lung problems to the fetus</strong>, therefore caution should be taken when this drug is administered to pregnant patients. Fluvoxamine should only be used when the patient, along with a physician, has determined that the <strong>benefits outweigh the risks</strong> associated with the drug. <br> <br> Patient who become pregnant while on Fluvoxamine should not immediately stop taking the drug, but turn to their doctor for ways to <strong>slowly diminish her intake of the drug</strong>. <br> <br> <strong>Infants exposed</strong> to Fluvoxamine within the last 3 months of pregnancy <strong>may develop withdrawal symptoms</strong> (abnormal crying, feeding difficulties, difficult breathing, seizures, muscle stiffness) and are at risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension- a fatal condition for newborns. <br> <br> Fluvoxamine <strong>will be passed to a newborn through breast milk</strong>. Nursing mothers are advised to NOT take this drug while breast feeding.<br> <br> <br></div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Fluvoxamine Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Fluvoxamine-84x84.jpg?1df917" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Fluvoxamine" title="Fluvoxamine" pagespeed_url_hash="3794485392" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></div><h2>What is Fluvoxamine?</h2><p>Fluvoxamine | Luvox is an <strong>antidepressant </strong>used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and other <strong>certain anxiety disorders</strong>, including panic, post-traumatic stress and social anxiety disorders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How does Fluvoxamine work?</h2><p>Fluvoxamine is part of a group called <strong>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong> (SSRIs) that stabilize unbalanced chemicals in the brain used to communicate with nerves. These chemicals, neurotransmitters, travel between nerves, and Fluvoxamine works by increasing the amounts of a certain neurotransmitter, serotonin, so more chemicals are available to <strong>prompt nerve stimulation</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>Fluvoxamine is released as a<strong> tablet (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg forms) and as an extended-release tablet (100 mg and 150 mg forms)</strong>.</p><p>Both should be taken orally, as whole. The tablet should be taken either once at bedtime, or twice a day, one tablet in the morning and one at bedtime. The extended-release tablet is taken only at bedtime, either with or without food.</p><p>Patients may begin taking a <strong>low dosage of Fluvoxamine (50 mg) to begin with</strong>, and have their dosage gradually increased by their doctor every 4-7 days by 50 mg. It may take a minimum of several weeks for the benefit of the drug to become apparent, so patients are advised to <strong>NOT suddenly stop taking Fluvoxamine</strong> as it may cause withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>The maximum dose of Fluvoxamine is 300 mg per day.</p><p><strong>Children</strong> may be given as little as 25 mg at the beginning of treatment, and increasing 25 mg every 4-7 days by a doctor, with a maximum dose of 200 mg a day for children 8-11 years old and 300 mg per day for children 12-17 years old.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Fluvoxamine</h2> Luvox<sup>®</sup><br/> <br/> Luvox<sup>®</sup> CR</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Fluvoxamine </strong></h2>
