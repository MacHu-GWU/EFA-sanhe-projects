It offers temporary relief of <strong>sinus congestion</strong> that is caused by bronchitis, allergies, influenza or the common cold. It is also sometimes used to prevent<strong> ear pain or blockage</strong> that is caused by pressure changes during air travel or underwater diving. Sudafed will only relieve nasal symptoms; it will not treat the cause of the symptom. It is manufactured by McNeil Laboratories (a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson).</p><h2>How does Sudafed work?</h2><p>Sudafed works by narrowing the blood vessels that are in the nasal passages. Swollen bleed vessels in the nose make it hard to breathe and cause feelings of congestion.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Sudafed is taken orally and is available in multiple forms: a regular tablet, a 12-hour extended-release tablet, a 24-hour extended-release tablet and a liquid. The dosage varies, depending on the form of Sudafed that is taken. In order to prevent insomnia, use Sudafed a few hours before sleeping. If your symptoms worsen or do not clear up after seven days, stop taking Sudafed and tell your doctor.</p><h3>Regular tablet</h3><ul><li>Once every four to six hours</li></ul><h3>12-hour extended-release tablet</h3><ul><li>Once every 12 hours</li><li>Do not take more than two doses in a 24-hour period</li><li>Swallow the tablets whole; do not chew or crush them</li></ul><h3>24-hour extended-release tablet</h3><ul><li>Once every 24 hours</li><li>Do not take more than one dose in a 24-hour period</li><li>Swallow the tablets whole; do not chew or crush them</li></ul><h3>Liquid form</h3><ul><li>Once every four to six hours</li><li>Use a measuring device (not your silverware) to pour the proper dosage of Sudafed</li></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Sudafed</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Sudafed</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Pseudoephedrine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Sudafed </strong></h2>
