It&#8217;s used to treat severe schizophrenia and to<strong> reduce the risk of suicidal behavior</strong> in people with <strong>schizophrenia</strong> or similar disorders. It is in a class of medications called atypical anti-psychotics, usually given when all other venues have been looked into without success. This medication only controls schizophrenia but <strong>does not cure it</strong>.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>How does Clozapine work?</strong></h2><p><strong>Clozapine exerts potent anticholinergic, adrenolytic, antihistaminic and antiserotoninergic activity</strong>. The absorption of the medication that is orally administered is 90 to 95%. It works by blocking receptors in the brain for several neurotransmitters, chemicals that nerves use to communicate with each other, including dopamine type 4 receptors, histamine receptors, serotonin type 2 receptors and norepinephrine receptors.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>Dosage information</strong></h2><p>Take exactly as directed by your doctor, no less or more or for longer than recommended. Make sure to follow the directions on your prescription label. It can be taken with or without food.</p><p>Take the regular oral tablet (Clozaril) with a full glass of water. Clozapine is given once, twice, or three times daily, with the dosage increasing slowly until optimal dose is found.</p><p>The orally disintegrating tablet shouldn&#8217;t be pushed through the foil, but instead the foil should be peeled back. The pill should immediately be placed on your tongue which will quickly dissolve. Take the medication around the same time(s) each every day.</p><p>Continue taking the medication even when you feel well. Do not stop taking Clozapine without talking to your doctor, who will gradually decrease the dose.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Clozapine</h2><h2><strong>Brand name</strong></h2><br/> Clozaril<br/> <br/> FazaClo<br/> <br/> Clopine<br/> <br/> CloZAPine Synthon<br/> <br/> Denzapine<br/> <br/> Zaponex</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Clozapine </strong></h2>
