PIP’s former director Claude Couty was also arrested at about the same time in La Seyne-sur-Mer, not far from Mas.</p><p>The founder of the now defunct company became the center of a public health scandal involving breast implants that Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP) produced beginning in 1991. It is estimated that anywhere between 300,000 and 400,000 women were recipients of the faulty implants around the world. <a target="_blank" title="France advises thousands to have breast implants removed" href="http://www.france24.com/en/20111220-france-tell-thousands-have-breast-implants-removed">France advises thousands to have breast implants removed</a> and the government is paying for the removal of the implants for all of the affected women. The U.K.’s NHS is subsidizing the removal of PIP implants in 40,000 British women (read more <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/01January/Pages/government-review-advises-on-french-pip-breast-implants.aspx">here</a>), and Jean-Claude Mas is being sued by over 1,000 women in South America who received the faulty cosmetic enhancements.</p><p>In 2001 PIP began using an industrial-grade silicon for their implants. The substance that was used had not only a higher propensity for rupture, but was far more likely to release toxic substances into the victim’s body. It is estimated that the rupture rate for PIP implants is between 8 and 10 percent.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/the-fda-banned-faulty-french-pip-implants-in-2000-262183.php">The FDA banned faulty French PIP implants in 2000</a>, but countries in other parts of the world haven’t followed suit. Though the recent events in France and other parts of Europe may call for a push to change things as they are.</p><p>British actress-turned-promotions-specialist Vanessa Halstead began a  campaign called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice4pipvictims.co.uk/">‘Justice 4 PIP Victims’</a> after her PIP implant nightmare. She said in a Daily Mail interview that, “I went for a spray tan one day and noticed by right breast was really swollen and almost the size of my head.” After removal of the faulty implants, Halstead started a campaign called “Justice 4 PIP Victims.” An initiative aimed at promoting stricter regulations for the cosmetics industry.</p><p>Joëlle Manighetti, a 30 year veteran worker in the French healthcare industry started a Facebook page called <a target="_blank" title="Civil Constitution Party against (Poly Implants Prosthese)" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/110673562283945/">Civil Constitution Party against PIP (Poly Implants Prosthese)</a> to spread awareness about her PIP implant experience. In a CNN interview, Manighetti says of the recent arrest of Jean-Claude Mas, &#8220;Too bad we do not have a justice system like they do in the United States which allows the accumulation of penalties &#8230; because the small punishment he will receive for what he did to 300,000 to 400,000 women, is not much compared to what we have suffered because of him.”</p><p><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/">Bad-Drug.net</a>, a site devoted to the empowerment of the patient through increasing awareness of all of the risks associated treatments and procedures, wants to hear your story.
