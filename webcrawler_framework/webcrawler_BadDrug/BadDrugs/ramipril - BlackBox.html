Ramipril may be used alone or in conjunction with other medicines for <strong>serious medical conditions</strong> such as:</p><ul><li>treating congestive heart failure</li><li>increasing health after a heart attack</li><li>preventing a hearth attack or stroke</li><li>treating diabetes</li><li>preventing kidney failure</li></ul><div>Ramipril<strong> is not</strong> a <strong>cure</strong> for high blood pressure.</div><p><strong>Ramipril</strong> should <strong>not</strong> be used by women who are<strong> pregnant</strong>.</p><h2>How Does Ramipril Work?</h2><p><strong>Angiotensin-converting enzymes</strong> (ACE) in the body normally work by releasing <strong>angiotensin II</strong> which causes artery muscles to tighten and <strong>contract</strong>. By blocking ACE, ramipril allows the artery walls to widen, accounting for an <strong>increased</strong> and more <strong>steady</strong> <strong>blood</strong> <strong>flow</strong> through these areas. As a result, <strong>blood pressure is lowered</strong> and the heart is <strong>not strained</strong> to work as hard. This reaction caused by ramipril also promotes an increased <strong>flow of oxygen</strong> throughout the body.</p><h2>Ramipril Dosage Information</h2><p><strong>Ramipril</strong> is given as a <strong>tablet</strong> to be taken orally. Ramipril is normally taken once or twice a day, <strong>depending</strong> on the patient&#8217;s treatment.<strong> Ask your doctor</strong> which dose of ramipril is right for you.

To ease an upset stomach you should take ramipril with a meal.</li><li>take ramipril at the <strong>same time each day</strong> to help you remember</li><li><strong>only</strong> take the amount <strong>prescribed</strong> by your doctor</li></ul><p><strong>Keep using ramipril</strong> until your prescription treatment is <strong>completed</strong>, even if you feel better.
