approved by the FDA on November 23<sup>rd</sup> of 2011 indicated for patients who’ve got problems with waking during sleep and who’ve got difficulty falling back to sleep.  The correct term for this condition is “early wakening” and is a form of <a target="_blank" href="http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">insomnia</a> that disables a person’s sleep patterns thereby affecting day-to-day activities and alertness.</p><p>The specific indications for this drug are for:</p><ul><li>Insomnia which is characterized by difficulty returning to sleep after middle-of-the-night awakening</li><li>Short term treatment for insomnia</li><li>Long term treatment for insomnia</li><li>Insomnia resulting from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</li></ul><p><b>Intermezzo | Zolpidem Tartrate</b> comes as sublingual tablets meant to be taken orally.  <b>Zolpidem Tartrate</b> is also known as <b><a target="_blank" href="http:/www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/ambien-cr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ambien CR</a></b>, which was first approved in the US in 1992 for the short term treatment for insomnia as well as certain brain disorders.</p><h2>How This Drug Works</h2><p><b>Intermezzo | Zolpidem Tartrate</b> is a hypnotic agent that’s unrelated to benzodiazepines or barbiturates.  This drug binds the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor subunit of a complex known as the GABA-A receptor complex that’s thought to be the source that’s responsible for sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and myorelaxant properties.  The preferential binding of <b>Zolpidem</b> to the BZ receptor may explain <b>Intermezzo | Zolpidem Tartrate’s</b> relaxing attributes, enabling a patient to get better sleep.</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>The safety and the efficacy of administering <b>Intermezzo | Zolpidem Tartrate</b> to pediatric patients has not been established as of yet.  The following is the adult dosage for this drug and is meant to convey a variance between adult male patients and female patients.  The difference between the doses for men and women is understood to be because of the slower metabolic clearance of this drug observed in female patients.</p><ul><li>The recommended and maximum dose for female patients is 1.75mg, taken once at night</li><li>The recommended and maximum dose for male patients is 3.5mg, taken once at night</li></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Intermezzo</h2><h2>Brand
