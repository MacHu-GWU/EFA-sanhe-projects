It helps to regulate the female reproductive system.  During menopause, the body decreases estrogen production and this leads to hot flashes.  Elestrin helps to supplement the decreased levels by adding bioidentical or synthetic estrogen into the bloodstream.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Elestrin is available as a topical gel in a pump spray container.  It should be sprayed on a freshly cleaned upper arm and rubbed into the skin.  The initial dose is one pump daily, which is .52 mg.  The dosage may be increased if the patient does not respond to the initial dose.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Elestrin</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Elestrin</li><br/><li>Estrasorb</li><br/><li>Divigel</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Estradiol Gel</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Elestrin </strong></h2>
