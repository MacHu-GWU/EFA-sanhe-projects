Cyclessa may aid in the following:</p><ul><li>maintaining a more regular and lighter menstrual period and decreasing premenstrual symptoms</li><li>reducing breakouts and acne</li><li>decreasing the risk of  pelvic inflammatory disease or infection of the ovaries or other reproductive organs</li><li>preventing infertility</li><li>protecting against cancers of the ovaries or endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining)</li><li>reducing bone loss</li></ul><div>In some cases, Cyclessa may decrease the risk of an<strong> ectopic pregnancy,</strong> which could be life-threatening.</div><p>Cyclessa <strong>should not</strong> be used in attempt to end a pregnancy.</p><h2>How Does Cyclessa Work?</h2><p>Cyclessa prevents conception in several ways. The primary method of action is preventing the body from <strong>ovulating</strong> (producing an egg in the ovary for fertilization). Cyclessa also <strong>thickens</strong> the <strong>cervical mucus</strong> and <strong>alters</strong> the<strong> lining of the uterus</strong> to prevent the sperm from being able to travel through the uterus or attach to the uterus wall. Through these processes, the sperm is unable to fertilize the egg and pregnancy cannot occur.</p><p>Cyclessa <strong>does not</strong> protect against <strong>sexually transmitted diseases</strong> (STDs).</p><h2>How to Take Cyclessa</h2><p>Cyclessa comes in<strong> tablet form</strong> to be taken in 28 day cycles. Cyclessa should be taken<strong> once daily</strong> with a full glass of water.<strong> Do not</strong> take Cyclessa more than 24 hours apart. Follow labeled instructions on what to do if you<strong> forget a dose</strong>. Be sure to use a backup form of birth control during the first few weeks of taking Cyclessa. Each 28-day pack of Cyclessa contains one week full of<strong> &#8220;reminder&#8221; pills</strong>. Your period should begin while you are taking the &#8220;reminder&#8221; pills.</p><p>Be sure to have <strong>extra packets</strong> of Cyclessa so that when you have finished one pack you will continue with the next without skipping any days.</p><p>Let your doctor know if you have any questions or if you have forgotten to take Cyclessa for several days. If you have not had your period in two months, <strong>you may be pregnant</strong>. Call your doctor <strong>immediately</strong> if you think you are pregnant.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Cyclessa</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Cyclessa</li><br/><li>Apr</li><br/><li>Azurette</li><br/><li>Caziant</li><br/><li>Cesia</li><br/><li>Desogen</li><br/><li>Emoquette</li><br/><li>Kariva</li><br/><li>Mircette</li><br/><li>Ortho-Cept</li><br/><li>Reclipsen</li><br/><li>Solia</li><br/><li>Velivet</li><br/><li>Viorele</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>ethinyl estradiol and desogestrel</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Cyclessa </strong></h2>
