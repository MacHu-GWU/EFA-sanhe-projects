This means that nose-bleeds, ulcers, or bruising may occur more easily and any bleeding will generally take longer to stop. Just an FYI, if you find blood in your urine, stool, or begin coughing up blood, SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. This could be a sign of a very serious problem.</li><li>The FDA released a statement in 2010 to announce that Plavix would now come with a black box warning. One reason is because some 2-14% of Plavix-treated patients don’t respond well to the drug, or don’t respond at all. Another is the severe internal bleeding that may come as a result of taking Plavix.</li><li>Plavix has also been the center of numerous lawsuits.
