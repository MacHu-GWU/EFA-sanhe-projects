Dexilant <strong>interferes</strong> with the production of acid and <strong>reduces levels of acid</strong> which may have previously been harmful to the stomach lining or esophagus. Preventing further damage of these areas can allow them to <strong>heal</strong> properly.</p><h2>How to Use Dexilant</h2><p>Dexilant comes in <strong>long-acting capsule form</strong> to be taken by mouth daily in <strong>60mg or 30mg doses</strong>.
