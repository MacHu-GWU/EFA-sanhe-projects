Not enough evidence has been found to declare an official warning for media outlets, but the FDA is working closely with Pramipexole's producers to intensify their research on the drug. While studies may suggest that there might be new cases of heart failure in Pramipexole users, the FDA has made it aware that the drug is safe to use. <br> <br><h2>Other warnings</h2> <br> Pramipexole cures the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome.

Pramipexole can also be used to treat symptoms of <strong>restless leg syndrome</strong> which is a discomfort and movement in the legs especially at night or while sitting.</p><p>Off-label treatments include <strong>cluster headaches and sexual dysfunction</strong> caused by antidepressants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How does Pramipexole work?</h2><p>Pramipexole is a dopamine imitator. Those with Parkinson&#8217;s disease usually have reduced or absent <strong>dopamine levels</strong>. Without dopamine present in the brain and nervous system, certain messages that transmit between nerves that aid in the movement of the body will not exist. <strong>Pramipexole works to correct the lack of dopamine</strong>, or a neurotransmitter, and aid in the symptoms low levels of dopamine causes and also stimulates some message receptor sites within the central nervous system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dosage information</h2><p>Pramipexole is a prolonged-release, <strong>oral tablet</strong> that comes in 0.25 mg, 1 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.5 mg and 0.125 mg form. It is usually taken three times a day for Parkinson&#8217;s disease and once a day 2-3 hours before bedtime to treat restless leg syndrome. The <strong>dosage for each patient is different</strong> as a doctor will decide what dosage is recommended based on the patients pre-existing factors and symptoms.</p><p>Patients will start Pramipexole at a <strong>low dose and will be gradually increased</strong> once every 4-7 days by a physician. It may take several weeks before the dosage becomes fitting for the patient. If taken with food, the medication may diminish the risk of nausea.</p><p>The dosage will usually begin at 0.125 mg three times a day but not exceed 4.5 mg a day for the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p><p>The dosage will usually being at 0.125 mg once a day 2-3 hours before bedtime but not exceed 0.5 mg per day for the treatment of restless leg syndrome.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Pramipexole</h2> Pramipexole is also known as Mirapex.</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Pramipexole </strong></h2>
