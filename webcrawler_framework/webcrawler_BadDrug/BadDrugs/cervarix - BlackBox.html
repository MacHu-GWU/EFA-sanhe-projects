HPV is the most common type of sexually transmitted infection. The virus often causes <strong>genital warts</strong>, but some forms of HPV can lead to <strong>cervical cancer</strong>. Many patients don&#8217;t display symptoms for a long period of time. Cervarix does not prevent diseases caused by all types of HPV. It also will not protect a patient from existing diseases.</p><h2>How does Cervarix work?</h2><p>Cervarix is a <strong>vaccine</strong> created to promote an immunity to HPV. The vaccine is based on the two most common types of HPV. Once the vaccine is administered, the patient&#8217;s immune system creates antibodies to respond to the virus, allowing the body to build an immunity without having to contract the virus.</p><h2>Cervarix Dosage Information</h2><p>Cervarix is an injection given to patients by trained medical professionals. It is an intramuscular type of injection to be administered into the upper part of the patient&#8217;s arm.</p><p>Three shots are required to complete the vaccination. Usually the second shot is given a month after the first shot. The third shot is administered 6 months after the initial shot. Make sure to keep all scheduled appointments with your healthcare provider.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Cervarix</h2> <strong>Brand name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Cervarix</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Cervarix </strong></h2>
