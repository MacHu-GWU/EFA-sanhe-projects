Fractures and delayed healing of bones have been reported. <br> <br> Since Amnesteem can be fatal to the fetus, patients should not donate blood during treatment, or for at least one month after treatment, in risk that the blood might be exposed to a pregnant woman. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Contraindications:</strong> <br> Contraindications include medications for seizures, oral steroids, antibiotics, vitamin A supplements, tetracyclines,  micro-dosed progesterone preparations, norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol, St. John's Wort, phenytoin, systemic corticosteroids, anticonvulsants and vitamin D supplements. <br> <br> <br> <strong>Family Planning:</strong> <br> <strong>Pregnant women SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION!</strong> <br> <br> Amnesteem is categorized by the FDA in <strong>pregnancy category X</strong>, meaning that the drug will cause severe fetal harm if taken while the patient is pregnant. This drug has a <strong>high risk for such birth defects</strong> as feature abnormalities, central nervous system defects, cardiovascular system complications, spontaneous abortion and miscarriages, thymus gland and parathyroid hormone abnormalities. <br> <br> In order to take Amnesteem, the patient must have a <strong>negative reading on a pregnancy test</strong> 30 days before beginning the drug, in between each prescription, after the last dosage of the drug, and 30 days after the discontinuation of Amnesteem. <br> <br> If the patient discovers she is pregnant, the fetus may be harmed, even if she has only taken Amnesteem for a short time. The <strong>pregnant female should discontinue Amnesteem immediately</strong> and seek medical attention for testing and monitoring. Patients should be warned that there is <strong>not an accurate way to determine if the fetus has been affected by the drug</strong>. <br> <br> <strong>Females should start using a primary and secondary forms of contraception</strong> together for 1 month before taking Amnesteem and for 1 month after discontinuation, with continuous pregnancy tests, and <strong>must attest to this in writing form with the iPLEDGE</strong>. <strong>Primary forms of birth control</strong> include tying tubes, vasectomy, intrauterine device (IUD), estrogen birth control pills and hormonal patches, implants, injections or vaginal rings, while <strong>secondary forms of birth control</strong> include latex condoms with spermicide, diaphragms with spermicide, cervical caps with spermicide and vaginal sponges with spermicide. <br> <br> Amnesteem has also been found in semen, but the amount transferred to a female sexual partnerwould not pose the same risks as if a female were taking the drug while becoming pregnant. Some risks are evident, but none to conclusively state that male sperm poses a threat when meeting with an egg. <br> <br> Nursing mothers are advised DO NOT BREASTFEED while taking Amensteem, and for 1 month after the discontinuation of the drug, as the drug can be passed through the breast milk.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Amnesteem Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/84x84xamnesteem-84x84.jpg,q1df917.pagespeed.ic.PWH0J6Bw5c.jpg" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Amnesteem" title="Amnesteem"/></div><h2>What is Amnesteem?</h2><p>Amnesteem is a retinoid used to <strong>treat severe acne</strong> (nodular or cystic acne) that hasn&#8217;t responded to any other medication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How does Amnesteem work?</h2><p>Sebum is facial oil that is released by oil glands that can cause severe acne. Amnesteem reduces the amount of sebum produced or released, and therefore decreases the amount of acne in the surrounding areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>Amnesteem comes in 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg capsules that should be swallowed whole and taken with meals. The dosage of Amnesteem is <strong>adjusted by a physician</strong> according to a patient&#8217;s condition and responses, but is usually taken for 15-20 weeks, twice a day.</p><p>After taking this drug, patient&#8217;s are advised to not lie down until more than 10 minutes. <strong>Acne may continue or worsen</strong> for the first couple of days, and it may take 1 to 2 months before the full effects take place. Before another form of acne medication can be started, patient&#8217;s must stop taking Amnesteem for at least 2 months.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Amnesteem</h2> Amnesteem is also known as Isotretinoin, Claravis and Sotret.</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Amnesteem </strong></h2>
