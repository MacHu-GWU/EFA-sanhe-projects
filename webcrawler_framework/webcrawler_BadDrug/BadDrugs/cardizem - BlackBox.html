Cardizem is generally prescribed along with a proper diet and exercise program for treatment.</p><h2>How Does Cardizem Work?</h2><p>Cardizem<strong> lowers blood pressure</strong> by causing the <strong>blood vessels</strong> to relax and dilate. By decreasing pressure, the heart no longer has to work as hard to pump blood throughout the body, and chest pain may be reduced. Cardizem also accounts for a higher supply of oxygen and blood being circulated through the heart.</p><h2>Cardizem Dosage Information</h2><p>Cardizem is available in <strong>tablet</strong>, <strong>extended-release tablet</strong> or <strong>extended-release capsule</strong>. Cardizem should be taken orally with a full glass of water.
