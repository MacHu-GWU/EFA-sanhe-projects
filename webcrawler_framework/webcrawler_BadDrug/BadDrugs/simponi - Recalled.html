Simponi is developed by Janssen Biotech, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><h2>How does Simponi work?</h2><p>Simponi works by restricting the activities of tumor necrosis factors, which are molecules in the human body that cause inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are all autoimmune disorders, conditions in which the body&#8217;s immune system attacks healthy parts of itself, thus resulting in pain, swelling and damage. By blocking the effects of TNF, Simponi relieves pain and inflammation in patients.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Simponi is available in a SmartJect autoinjector or pre-filled syringe. The recommended dosage is one 50 milligram injection per month.</p><p>You will receive your first dose of Simponi in your doctor&#8217;s office. After that, you may use Simponi at home as long as your doctor shows you or a friend the proper way of injecting it.</p><p>Store Simponi in your refrigerator until 30 minutes before you are ready to use it. Do not freeze it. Remove the autoinjector or syringe from its carton and place it on a flat surface so that it may warm up to room temperature. Do not attempt to warm it in boiling water or in the microwave. Leave the cap of the autoinjector or syringe on while you are warming it. The cap should be removed no more than five minutes before you administer Simponi.</p><p>Look through the viewing window of the syringe or autoinjector and make sure that the clear or pale yellow liquid in it is not cloudy or discolored. If it contains large, colored particles, do not use it. Instead, contact your pharmacist and report the problem. Additionally, ask about the best way of discarding used syringes or autoinjectors.</p><p>Simponi may be injected anywhere on the thighs or stomach, except the navel and the two-inch area around it. Do not inject Simponi into tender, bruised, red, scarred or stretch-marked skin. Be sure to rotate application sites every time. Choose a new spot that is at least one inch away from a previously used spot. If a friend or relative is giving you the dosage, he or she may also inject Simponi into your upper arms.</p><p>It is important to continue using Simponi even if you feel well. Speak with your doctor before you decide to discontinue your injections.</p><p>Patients who are on Simponi should not receive vaccinations.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Simponi</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Simponi</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Golimumab</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Simponi </strong></h2>
