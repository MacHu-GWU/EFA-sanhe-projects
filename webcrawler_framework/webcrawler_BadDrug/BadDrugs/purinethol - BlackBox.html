This disease can also be called<strong> acute lymphoblastic leukemia</strong> or <strong>lymphatic leukemia</strong>. It can also be used to treat other types of <strong>cancer</strong>, <strong>Crohn&#8217;s disease</strong>, and <strong>ulcerative colitis</strong>.</p><h2>How does Purinethol work?</h2><p>Cancer is caused by unregulated cell division.  <strong>Antimetabolites</strong> like Purinethol stop cells from being able to divide any further by attacking the affected cells during specific points of the cell division process. As the medication kills off these cells, tumors shrink and the spread of cancer is slowed or stopped. However, chemotherapy treatments are not able to differentiate between normal and &#8220;bad&#8221; cells. As a result, the medications stop all cell division during treatment. However, normal cells are reproduced healthily over time.</p><h2>Purinethol Dosage Information</h2><p>Purinethol is often taken once daily around the same time each day. Continue taking Purinethol for as long as your doctor has prescribed it to you, even if your symptoms improve.  Your doctor may adjust your dosage after observing your body&#8217;s response to treatment.</p><p>Drink ample amounts of liquid while taking Purinethol.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Purinethol</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Purinethol</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Mercaptopurine</li><br/><li>6-Mercaptopurine</li><br/><li>6-MP</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Purinethol </strong></h2>
