Ortho Evra does not protect against HIV/AIDS or any other sexually transmitted diseases.</p><h2>How does the Ortho Evra patch work?</h2><p>Ortho Evra is a transdermal patch applied to the skin as it releases a combination of synthetic estrogen and progestin hormones to prevent pregnancy.  It is shown that the success rate of women who use the Ortho Evra patch is significant compared to women who use oral contraceptives alone.  In the US, the Ortho Evra patch is marketed by Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical and is only available as a prescription.</p><h2>Application of Use</h2><p>A woman applies the first patch onto either her abdomen, thigh, posterior or the upper part of her arm on the first day of her menstrual cycle or the first Sunday following the first day.  The date of the application is known as “patch change day”.  About 7 days later, the patch change day comes again and the woman removes the patch and applies another patch on the aforementioned parts of the body.  The process is repeated until the next patch change day.  However on the following patch change day, the Ortho Evra patch is removed by the woman and is not replaced by a new patch.  The woman waits 7 days without a patch on her body and by the time of the next patch change day, she applies a new patch.</p><p>It is strongly advisable that the area of the body where the patch is applied should completely clean, dry and intact and there shouldn’t be skin irritations or cuts on the skin prior to the patch being applied.  Also one should avoid using lotions and other beauty products around the area where the patch is applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Ortho Evra Birth Control Patch</h2> Ethinyl Estradiol Norelgestromin</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Ortho Evra Birth Control Patch </strong></h2>
