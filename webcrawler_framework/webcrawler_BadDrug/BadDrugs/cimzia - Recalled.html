It also remedies moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. </span></p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>Cimzia works by restricting the activities of tumor necrosis factors, which are molecules in the human body that cause inflammation.</p><h2>How to take it?</h2><p>Cimzia comes in two forms. The first is a powder that is mixed with water and injected into the skin by a health professional in a medical office. The second form is a pre-filled syringe that is injected by the patient in the privacy of his or her home.</p><p>Cimzia may be injected anywhere on the thighs or abdomen, except the navel and the two-inch area around it. Do not inject Cimzia into tender, bruised, red, scarred or stretch-marked skin. Be sure to rotate application sites every time. Choose a new spot that is at least one inch away from a previously used spot. For Crohn&#8217;s disease, the first dose of Cimzia should be 400 milligrams. This should be followed by 400 milligram injections during weeks two and four. Subsequent 400 milligram injections should be given every four weeks. For rheumatoid arthritis, the first dose of Cimzia should be 400 milligrams. This should be followed by 400 milligram injections during weeks two and four. Subsequent 200 milligram injections should be given every other week.</p><p>If a patient chooses to inject Cimzia at home, he or she should make sure that the substance in the syringe is clear or pale yellow. If it contains large, colored particles, do not use it. Instead, the patient should contact a pharmacist and report the problem.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Certolizumab pegol</h2><h2><strong>Brand Name</strong></h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Cimzia</li><br/></ul><br/><h2><strong>Generic Name</strong></h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Certolizumab pegol</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Certolizumab pegol </strong></h2>
