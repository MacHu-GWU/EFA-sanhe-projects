Because this product can cause serious and/or fatal consequences, it is classified as a Class I recall.This particular type of mesh patch is used to repair ventral hernias that can become apparent when scar tissue from the original hernia repair surgery was thinned or stretched. The patch is held open by a "memory recoil ring" that can later lay flat once the tissue is healed.The recall is due to the mesh patch's coil being susceptible to breakage under the stress in the abdominal area. This breakage can lead to ruptures in the bowel and/or recurring unnatural connections to the intestines and organs.For more information click <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm152454.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Hernia mesh Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Hernia-Mesh-84x84.jpg?1df917" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Hernia mesh" title="Hernia mesh" pagespeed_url_hash="2864820047" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></div><h2>What is Hernia Mesh?</h2><p>Hernia mesh is surgical mesh used in <strong>hernia repair</strong>. It is made out of thin, synthetic, plastic-like material used to hold the weak tissue (fascia) in place after the protruding herniated organ is returned to its position. Most hernia mesh is made out of polypropylene, which can be flat like a patch or a plug shape to secure the hole the protruding organ created. Hernia mesh is used to treat hernia by adherence.</p><h2>How Does Hernia Mesh work?</h2><p>The mesh will be held in place with sutures (surgical stitches) and will provide a lattice structure for new tissue to grow on. The mesh is thin and strong, but soft and flexible so it may accommodate the body&#8217;s movement. Mesh is used when the hole in the tissue is greater than 2 cm. and the size of the mesh can vary according to what is necessary to securely reunite the tissue.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Hernia mesh</h2> <strong>Generic Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li><span style="line-height: 12.986111640930176px;">hernia surgical mesh implants</span></li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Brand Names:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li><span style="line-height: 12.986111640930176px;">Davol</span></li><br/><li>Bard Composix Kugel</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Hernia mesh </strong></h2>
