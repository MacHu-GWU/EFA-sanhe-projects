For those with the <strong>G551D mutation</strong>, it helps weight gain, lowers chloride levels in sweat, and improves lung function.</p><h2>How does Kalydeco work?</h2><p>Kalydeco enhances the functions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<strong>CFTR</strong>) protein. The G551D mutation causes the CFTR protein to block proper flow of fluids and salt in and out of cells. By freeing the flow of salt and fluids, Kalydeco thins the mucus build up in the lungs that causes cystic fibrosis.</p><h2>Kalydeco Dosage Information</h2><p>The typical dose of Kalydeco is one tablet every 12 hours with fatty foods including butter, eggs, peanut butter, and cheese.</p><p>For those with hepatic impairments, Kalydeco is usually taken once daily. If the patient is also using powerful CYP3A inhibitors, the dose is reduced to twice a week.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Kalydeco</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Kalydeco</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Ivacraftor</li><br/><li>VX-770</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Kalydeco </strong></h2>
