Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are naturally-produced antigens found on white blood cells, known as T cells, which protect the body from infections. These CTL antigens can prevent T cells from working, and inhibit the body&#8217;s immune response to diseases, such as cancer. Yervoy prevents the action of CTLs, which then allows the T cells to multiply work effectively to destroy cancer cells. Yervoy also works to stunt the growth of new cancer cells.</p><h2>Dosage information for Yervoy</h2><p>Yervoy&#8217;s recommended dosage is 3 mg/kg administered by a medical professional for 90 minutes every 3 weeks for a total of 4 times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Yervoy</h2><h2>Brand name:</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Yervoy</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic name:</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>ipilimumab injection</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Yervoy </strong></h2>
