Epinephrine is used for the treatment of allergic situations, and for those who are at risk of <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> (severe, life-threatening reactions). It is produced by Sanofi.</p><h2>How does Auvi-Q work?</h2><p>Auvi-Q provides the user with a <strong>step-by-step guide</strong> of how to use the epinephrine injection once the device is removed from its case, and can repeat audio and visual steps if necessary. This epinephrine pen (epi pen) includes a five-second countdown and an alert light to indicate that the injection has been completed. Unlike most epipens, Auvi-Q has a <strong>retractable needle</strong> to prevent accidents stemming from needle pricks.</p><p>An epipen contains the medicine epinephrine, or adrenaline, to obstruct an allergic reaction before anaphylactic shock can occur. The adrenaline prepares the body for the extra energy it is preparing to produce, and reverses the symptoms of anaphylactic shock by stimulating adrenergic receptors. Adrenaline makes the blood vessels narrow, which stops the blood pressure from decreasing too much and then directs blood to vital organs. This adrenaline will open airways in the lungs and make the heart beat stronger.</p><h2>Dosage information</h2><p>Auvi-Q comes in <strong>two types of dosages</strong>, each being single-use. The 0.3 mg dosage is for patients who weigh 66 pounds or more, and is typically considered to be the adult dosage. The 0.15 mg dosage is for patients weighing 33-66 pounds- the children&#8217;s dosage.</p><p>Each pack is built for easy storage at <strong>room temperature</strong> and is similar to a deck of cards (3.5 inches tall by 2 inches wide by 0.5 inches thick).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div title="Page 1"><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Auvi-Q</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Auvi-Q</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong> Generic Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>epinephrine injection</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Auvi-Q </strong></h2>
