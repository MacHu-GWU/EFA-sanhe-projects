Phenobarbital may also calm those with<strong> anxiety issues</strong> to aid them in sleep for up to two weeks at a time, can be used as a sedative before surgery, and can also be used to <strong>prevent withdrawal symptoms</strong> after an addiction.</p><h2>How does Phenobarbital work?</h2><p>Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant/hypnotic and a central nervous system depressant. It causes sedation and sleepiness by slowing the electrical activity in the brain, and suppressing abnormal activity in the brain that happens during a seizure.</p><h2>Dosage information for Phenobarbital</h2><p>Phenobarbital is produced either in tablet or elixir (liquid) form to be taken one to three times daily.</p><p>Phenobarbital is recommended to be taken with a full glass of water by mouth with or without food depending on the patient&#8217;s preference.</p><p>Dosage can vary and is dependent on the patient&#8217;s weight (for children), medical condition, blood levels, and the response to other treatments. The patient&#8217;s phenobarbital dosage may start low and be gradually increased so that they may avoid harsh side effects. The preferred dosage may take weeks to reach, and the dosage must stay constant so therefore it must be taken at the same time every day. If the patient misses a dose, they are advised to take it as soon as they remember. Doubling your dosage is not recommended.</p><p>Tablets come in 15 mg, 30 mg, and 100 mg made of corn starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, and sodium starch glycolate.
