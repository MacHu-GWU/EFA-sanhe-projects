This makes more of these chemicals available in the body to provide a calm mental state, and sedate hyperactive activity in patients.</p><h2>Focalin dosing instructions</h2><p>Focalin is available as an extended-release capsule which is approved for use in patients 6 years of age or older. This medication should be taken in a single, morning dosage to ensure that the medication is absorbed by the body as the day progresses. Although you may take this medication alone or with a meal, food is thought to hinder the absorption of Focalin in the body and cause the medication to work more slowly than expected.</p><p>If a child patient has difficulty swallowing the capsule, you may break the capsule and mix the contents with applesauce. However, these beads should not be crushed or chewed as this can release too much medication into the body. If too much medication is ingested, seek emergency help immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Focalin</h2> <strong>Brand name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Focalin</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>dexmethylphenidate</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Focalin </strong></h2>
