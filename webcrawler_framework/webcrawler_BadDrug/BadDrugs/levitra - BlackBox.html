Follow-ups on these patients have been difficult to track; the FDA is still unsure whether these serious side effects are caused by the medicine, or the patient's condition of erectile dysfunction. Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corporation <strong>has modified</strong> the label on Levitra to warn patients of these <strong>possible risks</strong>.<strong>Do not</strong> take Levitra if you:<ul><li>Are taking <strong>nitrates</strong> used to control chest aching or angina, or if you are taking "poppers" such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate. Levitra in combination with these drugs may cause <strong>extremely low blood pressure</strong>. If you are <strong>not</strong> sure if you have taken or are taking nitrates, <strong>ask your doctor</strong> before using Levitra.</li><li>Take other erectile dysfunction medications such as Cialis or Viagra.</li><li>Are a<strong> female</strong>, especially if you are pregnant, may become pregnant or are breast-feeding.
