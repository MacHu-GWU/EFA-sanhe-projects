Be sure to<strong> let your healthcare provider know</strong> about any medicines you are using, particularly:<ul><li>medicines for treating high amounts of uric acid including indigestion, ulcers and gout</li><li>congestive heart failure treatments</li><li>blood thinners, especially <a title="Warfarin" href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/warfarin" target="_blank">Warfarin</a></li><li>antifungals</li><li>dieting pills</li><li>steroids, cancer medications, drugs for reducing rejection of organ transplants, and other drugs that could lower the defense of your immune system</li><li>other "statin" medications or drugs containing fenofibric acid</li></ul><div>Tell your doctor if you are using <strong>any other drugs</strong> for treating your condition including amiodarone, diltiazem, amlodipine, ranolazine or verapamil.</div><h3>Grapefruit and Zocor Interaction</h3> <strong>Avoid</strong> any consumption of <strong>grapefruit</strong> while taking <strong>Zocor,</strong> including grapefruit juice. Grapefruit can <strong>interact</strong> with Zocor by interfering with enzymes which control the breakdown of medications, and in this case, statins. This can lead to a <strong>buildup of high concentrations of Zocor</strong> in the body, causing dangerous side effects. Grapefruit and Zocor combination can even cause<strong> liver damage</strong> or <strong>muscle breakdown</strong> and <strong>damage of the kidney</strong> (rhabdomylosis).<h2></h2></div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Zocor Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/84x84xzocor-tablets-and-bottle-84x84.jpg,q1df917.pagespeed.ic.NEzSlMbPCk.jpg" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Zocor" title="Zocor"/></div><p><strong>Zocor</strong> | Simvastatin is a &#8220;<strong>statin</strong>&#8221; (HMG CoA reductase inhibiting) medicine marketed by Merck &amp; Co. for treating <strong>high-cholesterol</strong> or patients who are at risk for developing <strong>serious cardiovascular conditions</strong>.

While reducing cholesterol levels, Zocor <strong>prevents</strong> triglycerides and <strong>&#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol</strong> (low-density lipoprotein)  from being created and <strong>stimulates</strong> the production of <strong>&#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol</strong> (high-density lipoprotein).</p><h2>Zocor Dosage Information</h2><p><strong>Zocor</strong> is prescribed in <strong>tablet</strong> form.
