This drug may exacerbate these health issues.</li><li>Formoterol can increase the risk of asthma-related death. If your asthma is becoming progressively worse, you should not take Symbicort. If your asthma is well controlled without taking a drug like Formoterol or another long-acting beta agonist (LABA), you should not take these drugs due to the risks involved.</li><li> Symbicort will not replace a fast-acting asthma medication. If you need a rescue inhaler speak with your doctor as soon as possible to obtain one.</li><li>People with SOPD are already at an increased risk for lung infections. Inhaled steroid medications may increase this underlying risk.</li><li>Symbicort may have adverse immune system side effects.

It is important to note that asthma can’t be cured, though with proper lifestyle modifications and the use of medications this disease can usually be controlled.</p><p>Symbicort is a combination of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11687183">budesonide</a> (an anti-inflammatory agent) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.medicinenet.com/bronchodilator-aerosol_oral_inhaler/article.htm">bronchodilator</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formoterol">formoteral</a>. These work together to both prevent asthma symptoms and treat acute asthma attacks in those individuals that suffer from asthma or bronchitis. Although organizations such as the Global Initiative for Asthma (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ginasthma.org/">GINA</a>) has approved this medication for the treatment of acute symptoms of asthma, the FDA has only approved its use as a maintenance treatment for the condition.</p><h2>How does Symbicort work?</h2><p>When inhaled, the corticosteroid budesonide stops cells in the lungs from producing chemicals that aid in the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation">inflammation</a> response. This helps keep the airways from constricting due to swelling which coupled with mucus may cause the symptoms of asthma and asthma attack.</p><p>The drug formoterol is a bronchodilator. It opens and relaxes airways helping those who suffer from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SOPD) to breathe more easily.</p><h2>Symbicort dosage</h2><ul><li>Symbicort comes as an MDI or metered dose inhaler. Remember to shake the inhaler at least 5 times gently before each use and test spray the product at least once before you begin using each inhaler.</li><li>Do not spray the medicine to the back of the throat. In order for Symbicort to work, you must ensure that you breathe in deeply each time you spray the medicine.</li><li>Wait one minute between sprays.</li><li>It is important to remember that Symbicort is not a rescue inhaler. Your doctor will prescribe a rescue inhaler to treat sudden onset of asthma symptoms.</li><li>For asthma, the recommended dose is between two inhalations of Sybbicort 80/4.5 twice a day to two inhalations of Symbicort 160/4.5 twice a day.</li><li>For chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), the dose is 160/4.5 twice a day.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Symbicort</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Symbicort</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic (unavailable):<br/><ul><br/><li>formoterol and budesonide</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Symbicort </strong></h2>
