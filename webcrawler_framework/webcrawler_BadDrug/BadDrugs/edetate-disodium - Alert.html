However<strong> it is different than the the drug Edetate Calcium Disodium</strong> which is used to treat lead poisoning using the same chelating treatment. Both drugs use this chelating agent to pass the heavy metals through the urine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How does Edetate Disodium work?</h2><p>Edetate Disodium chemically binds (chelates) to metals and minerals in the blood, virtually stopping the negative effects of the excess metals and minerals by <strong>producing a serum after binding</strong>. After the chelate is formed, the solution will be excreted in the urine over the next 24 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>Edetate Disodium is given intravenously by a medical professional <strong>with an infusion rate over 3 hours, for at least 5 consecutive days with one day of rest, completing a set</strong>. Sets should be repeated, as much as 15 times, until calcium levels return to a healthy level.</p><p>For adults the recommended dosage is 50 mg per kg of a patient&#8217;s body weight, <strong>not to exceed 3 g in 24 hours</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After patients receive Edetate Disodium, they will need to remain in a lying position, as the <strong>lowering of calcium levels can naturally cause a drop in blood pressure</strong>. Patients will need to be closely watched to monitor effects and calcium levels.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Edetate Disodium</h2> Edetate Disodium is also known as:<br/><ul><br/><li>Disotate</li><br/><li>Endrate</li><br/><li>Meritate</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Edetate Disodium </strong></h2>
