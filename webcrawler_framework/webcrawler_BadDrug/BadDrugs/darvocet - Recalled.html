<h1 itemprop="aspect"> <strong>Darvocet Side Effects</strong></h1></div><div class="v" id="tab2" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Warnings & Recalls for Darvocet </strong></h2> From 1978 groups such as <a href="http://www.citizen.org/Page.aspx?pid=183">Public Citizen</a> pushed for a Darvocet recall. They cited that evidence even at that time suggested that the drug was not only relatively ineffective, but that it had <strong>highly toxic heart side effects</strong> at doses not much higher than what was recommended. In fact, propoxyphene, one of the main components of Darvocet, is the drug of choice for right to die groups who use it in suicide cocktails for those terminally ill patients who choose to end their lives.In 2010, Sidney Wolf, director of Public Citizen, said that “Due to <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a> negligence, at least 1,000-2,000 or more people in the U.S. have died from using propoxyphene since the time that the U.K. ban was announced.” This statement came six years after the U.K. announced their Darvocet recall. A complete listing of those who have lost their lives as a result of taking the drug will probably never be known.If you or someone close to you has experienced any Darvocet related side effects <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">report it here.</a> Doing so may help spread awareness about the possible dangerous side effects associated with this drug.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Darvocet Treatment and Use </strong></h2><p>Darvocet, or dextropropoxyphene (generic), is a weak opioid narcotic medication that was used from 1957-2010 (U.S.) to treat mild to moderate pain. It is still in use in parts of the world outside of the United States and Europe and is manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.</p><p>Dextropropoxyphene is composed of acetaminophen (the same active ingredient in Tylenol) and propoxyphene, an opioid pain reliever. It belongs to a class of drugs known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/patient-corner/drugforms/narcotics.pdf">narcotic analgesics</a> and acts by changing the way the brain perceives pain. This means that although the pain mechanism is still in motion, your Darvocet-affected brain doesn’t quite tell you that it hurts.</p><h2>How is (was) Darvocet administered?</h2><p>This is kind of a trick question. Darvocet is no longer administrable in the United States and in the European Union. Before the Darvocet recall (and in parts of the world that are still able to get a hold of it), dextropropoxyphene was available as Darvocet N-50, Darvocet N-100, and Darvocet A500 tablets, as well as the Darvon capsules. Maximum daily doses (administered orally) were not to exceed 600 mg. of the propoxyphene, and 4,000 mg of the acetaminophen.</p><h3></h3><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Darvocet</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Darvocet</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic:<br/><ul><br/><li>Propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Darvocet </strong></h2>
