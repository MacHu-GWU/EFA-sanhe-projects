Although <strong>new evidence suggests</strong> that newly diagnosed patients who receive a small amount of Mylotarg combined with chemotherapy may prolong a patient's life, the relaunch of Mylotarg will have to be under a new drug application and resubmitted to the FDA.For more information click <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm216448.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<h2>Other warnings</h2><ul><li><strong>Tumor Lysis Syndrome</strong> will present itself within 24-48 hours after therapy.

It was first approved by the FDA in 2000, but later taken off the market by Pfizer in 2010.</p><h2>How does Mylotarg work?</h2><p>Mylotarg is a monoclonal antibody cancer therapy treatment. Antibodies are created in the body to defend against antigen proteins by attaching to the antigens so the immune system will attack it at a later time. Monoclonal means that the antigens and antibodies have been identified and the antigens can be specifically attacked. Mylotarg contains the bound form of calicheamicin and monoclonal antibody. This specific antibody targets the CD33+ antigen (which is found on leukemic cells in more than 80% of patients with AML) and destroys it.</p><h2>Dosage information for Mylotarg</h2><p>Mylotarg is given intravenously (into a vein) by a medical professional. The recommended dosage of Mylotarg is 9 mg/m2 infused over a 2-hour time span twice with 14 days between the doses but the amount that a patient receives <strong>will vary</strong> depending on height/weight, health factors, and the severity of the cancer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Mylotarg</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Mylotarg</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>gemtuzumab ozogamicin</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Mylotarg </strong></h2>
