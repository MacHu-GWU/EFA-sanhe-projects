href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chemotherapy</a> drug that is manufactured and marketed by the drug company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lilly.com/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eli Lilly</a>.  It is indicated for the treatment of:</p><ul><li>Malignant <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesothelioma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mesothelioma</a> of pleura (in combination with cisplatin in patients who aren’t candidates for surgical resection)</li><li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/non-small-cell-lung/Patient/page1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Non-small cell lung cancer</a> (locally advanced or nonsquamous metastatic)</li></ul><p>The chemical structure was developed in 2004 in conjunction with Princeton University as well as Eli Lilly.  <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed</strong> is in a class of medications called antifolate antineoplastic agents and works primarily in blocking the actions of a certain substance in the patient’s body that causes cancer cells to multiply.  <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed</strong> prevents the formation of <a target="_blank" title="DNA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DNA</a> and <a target="_blank" title="RNA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RNA</a>, which are required for the growth and survival of both normal cells and cancer cells.  It comes in the form of an injection.</p><p>There are adverse reactions to <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed</strong> which are primarily gastrointestinal that include loss of appetite and nausea.  Fatigue accounts for a huge proportion of <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed’s</strong> adverse side effects as well.</p><h2>How does Alimta work?</h2><p>The mechanism of action for <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed</strong> is as an antifolate containing the pyrrolopyrimidine-based nucleus that exerts its antineoplastic activity by disrupting folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cancer cell replication.  <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed</strong> is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein systems in the bodies of patients who have malignant mesothelioma of pleura or non-small cell lung cancer.  <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed, </strong>when used with cisplatin, has proven to be effective for these types of cancers.</p><p>It is worth noting that in 2010, <strong>Alimta </strong><strong>| Pemetrexed’s</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibj.com/court-upholds-lilly-patent-on-cancer-drug-alimta/PARAMS/article/23471" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">revenue was over $2 billion</a>.</p><h2>Alimta Treatment</h2><p>It is vital for patients who are receiving Alimta to taking certain supplements before and during treatment to diminish the risk of serious side effects. Patients should take the following supplements as instructed:</p><ul><li><strong>Folic Acid</strong> | every day for a minimum of 5 out of 7 days prior to your first Alimta treatment. Folic acid should be taken continuously over the course of treatment, and for up to 21 days after treatment completion.</li><li><strong>B12 injections</strong> | administered by a doctor during treatment, with the first injection given a week before the first Alimta treatment, and the remaining injections given every 9 weeks during treatment.</li></ul><h2>Contacting Someone Who Can Help You</h2><p>If you or a loved one have experienced serious side effects as a result of taking this drug, please do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">contact someone who can help you</a>.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Alimta</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Alimta</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic (Unavailable):</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Pemetrexed</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Alimta </strong></h2>
