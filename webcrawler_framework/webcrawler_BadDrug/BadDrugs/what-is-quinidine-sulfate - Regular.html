Its classification is that of an antiarrhythmic medication and can only be prescribed by a doctor. It has also been known to treat malaria. It is derived from the bark of a tree in Peru called the <em>cinchona</em>.</p><p>There are 3 actions which enable quinidine sulfate to work as an antiarrhythmic and to stop arrhythmia from occurring again. It decreases the speed of the electrical current which travels through the heart muscle which causes its cells to contract. It lengthens the period in which heart muscle cells become electrically stimulated to contract and prolongs recovery after contraction during which the cells can’t be contracted through stimulation. Quinidine sulfate was approved by the FDA in 1950. It can be administered orally through a pill or be given by injection.</p><p>Before or during a heart physician prescribes a patient quinidine sulfate, they usually give them warfarin, which works as an anticoagulant and doctors have also been known to prescribe beta-blockers like metoprolol to alleviate blood clots and slow a patient’s pulse. When administering quinidine sulfate, a doctor usually gives a test dose to see if the patient might have an adverse reaction to it. It is strongly advised to take the medication on an empty stomach and it also advised to not lie down after taking this medication for 10 minutes. The amount of sodium a patient ingests also plays a crucial role when it comes to this medication, so it is advised that a patient should keep a regular correspondence with a doctor when it comes to this medication.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Quinidine Sulfate</h2> Quinidine</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Quinidine Sulfate </strong></h2>
