It is also popularly prescribed for treatment of depression, social anxiety and social phobia.</p><h2><strong>How does Luvox work?</strong></h2><p>Luvox works by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical that is used in the process of sending messages from one nerve cell to another. When a message travels through a nerve, the nerve ending releases serotonin. When serotonin gets to the next nerve cell in the chain, receptors are activated and the message continues along the line. The cell that released the serotonin then reabsorbs any residual chemical that is in the gap. This is called “reuptake.” Under normal circumstances, this process occurs without any problems.</p><p>When there is not enough serotonin between nerve cells, disorders such as depression or anxiety may occur. Luvox blocks the reuptake of serotonin (more than the other SSRI&#8217;s) so that more of it remains in between the brain’s nerve cells. Serotonin then has a better chance of activating the chemical receptors on the next nerve cell. This is believed to enhance mood and alleviate some of the symptoms of OCD or social anxiety.</p><div><h2><strong>How to take Luvox</strong></h2><p>Luvox comes in tablet form, usually started in daily 50 mg doses and gradually increased to 100 mg to 300 mg doses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3></h3><h3></h3><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Luvox</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Luvox</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic:<br/><ul><br/><li>Fluvoxamine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Luvox </strong></h2>
