This hormone, known as thyroxine, regulates energy and metabolism, and effects many bodily functions. Unithroid acts as a substitute for the thyroxine that an underactive thyroid is unable to produce, and helps maintain both mental and physical activities that the thyroid is essential to regulating.</p><h1>Symptoms of an Underactive Thyroid</h1><ul><li>Results in poor growth in children</li><li>Slowed speech</li><li>Lack of energy or listlessness</li><li>Sudden weight gain</li><li>Hair loss</li><li>Dried out or thickened skin</li><li>Increased sensitivity to cold</li></ul><h2>Unithroid Dosage Information</h2><p>Unithroid is an oral tablet which is typically prescribed in small doses before being increased as your healthcare physician sees fit.
