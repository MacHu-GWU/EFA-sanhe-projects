The black box warning is an indication of an increased risk of severe or life-threatening complications.At the beginning of 2012, the FDA released a statement warning pregnant women against taking Paxil along with 9 other anti-depressants during pregnancy, as doing so increases the risk of serious birth defects.Other Paxil side effects include:<ul><li>Nausea</li><li>Dry mouth</li><li>Drowsiness</li><li>Insomnia</li><li>Increased sweating</li><li>Tremor</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Sexual Side Effects (Reported more often than with other ssris)</li><li>Anxiety</li><li>Upper respiratory ailments</li><li>Pathological Laughter</li><li>Vaginal Anaesthesia</li></ul> One of the rarest and possibly life-threatening Paxil side effects is <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm124349.htm">serotonin syndrome</a>, a serious and sometimes deadly reaction to too much serotonin in the body. Symptoms occur within minutes to hours of onset and includes:<ul><li>Agitation</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Fast or irregular heartbeat</li><li>Loss of coordination and Hallucinations</li><li>Over reactive reflexes</li><li>Tremor, or</li><li>Confusion</li></ul> Taking Paxil with other serotogenic agents increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. If you begin exhibiting these symptoms after taking Paxil, seek medical attention immediately and <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">report your experiences</a>.

Initial dosing should start at 20 mg a day and can be increased to a maximum of 50 mg a day.</p><p>For anxiety or panic related disorders, the initial dose of Paxil is 10 mg a day and can be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 60 mg a day. It should be noted that there is no study indicating that doses higher than 20 mg a day have shown any significant benefit in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorder.</p><p>Special precautions and lower doses are given to the elderly, people with special medical concerns, or people suffering from liver disease to avoid a significant increase in the presence and severity of Paxil side effects.</p><p>Remember to discuss with your doctor all questions and concerns you may have about Paxil</p><h2><strong>How does Paxil work?</strong></h2><p>Paxil works by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, or chemical that is used in the process of sending messages from one nerve cell to another. When a message travels through a nerve, the nerve ending releases serotonin. When serotonin gets to the next nerve cell in the chain, receptors are activated and the message continues along the line. The cell that released the serotonin then reabsorbs any residual chemical that is in the gap. This is called “reuptake.” Under normal circumstances, this process occurs without any problems.</p><p>When there is not enough serotonin between nerve cells, disorders such as depression or anxiety may occur. Paxil blocks the reuptake of serotonin (more than any other ssri) so that more of it remains in between the brain’s nerve cells. Serotonin then has a better chance of activating the chemical receptors on the next nerve cell. This is believed to enhance mood and alleviate some of the symptoms of your OCD or social anxiety.</p><h2><strong>What should you know before taking Paxil?</strong></h2><ul><li>Your doctor will determine whether Paxil is right for you based on factors such as weight, age, and personal medical history. Be sure to tell your doctor if you are allergic to any medications or if you have any known food allergies.</li><li>The elderly have age-specific problems that limit the usefulness of Paxil. Because of liver problems associated with the elderly, older patients should receive a decreased dosage.</li></ul><h2></h2></div></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Paxil (Paroxetine)</h2></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Paxil (Paroxetine) </strong></h2>
