It is because of the devastating consequences of this and mental health disorders like OCD and anxiety disorder, that many people with the aid of their psychiatrists, psychologists, or in some cases their personal physicians, choose to turn to anti-depressants. The number one category of which, is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI.</p><p>SSRIs are drugs that selectively block the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin when nerve endings send impulses to one another. This leaves more serotonin in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biologymad.com/nervoussystem/synapses.htm">synaptic cleft</a> (the space between the nerves). The list of drugs included on the ssri roster are:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/prozac">Prozac</a> (Fluoxetine)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/what-is-luvox-fluvoxamine">Luvox</a> (Fluvoxamine)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/what-is-celexa-citalopram">Celexa</a> (Citalopram)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/what-is-lexapr…lopram-oxalate">Lexapro</a> (Escitalopram)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/paxil-paroxetine">Paxil</a> (Paroxetine)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/zoloft">Zoloft</a> (Sertraline)</li><li><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/viibryd-vilazodone">Viibryd</a> (Vilazodone)</li></ul><p>In addition to treating clinical depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to alleviate the symptoms of general anxiety, social phobia, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001926/">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>, panic disorder, and premature ejaculation just to name a few. SSRIs are so ubiquitous in the treatment of mental and mood disorders that they are often the first line of treatment and thought (unjustifiably) by many patients to be harmless, though this is far from accurate. Below are some of the potential side effects of ssris that were reviewed in an issue of the Harvard Mental Health Letter. They include:</p><ul><li>Rashes, headaches, joint and muscle pain, and gastrointestinal difficulties, as well as stomach or uterine bleeding (ssris more than doubles the risk of NSAID related stomach bleeding)</li><li>Diminished sexual interest, satisfaction, desire, and/or performance (the number one reason for men to discontinue treatment with ssris)</li><li>Suicide. All ssris come with an FDA mandated <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/">Black Box Warning</a>. This is due to reports of an increase in suicidal ideation among children, adolescents, and young adults.</li><li>Serotonin syndrome. This one is particularly serious and results from too much serotonin in the bloodstream. Symptoms include: rapid heartbeat, muscle twitching, confusion, anxiety, and loss of motor control. If you experience these symptoms while taking an ssri, be sure to seek medical attention immediately.</li></ul><p>It is important that before beginning treatment with an ssri you do your research and speak with your health care provider to understand any and all possible risks involved with starting an ssri treatment regimen. <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">Becoming an informed patient is becoming an empowered patient.</a> Doing so greatly helps reduce your chances of serious and sometimes life-threatening complications.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)</h2></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) </strong></h2>
