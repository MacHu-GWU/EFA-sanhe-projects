The onset of infection is marked specifically with fever higher than 100.5°F (38°C). Oftentimes, chemotherapy can’t make the distinction between cancer cells and those that are normal healthy cells, resulting in lower white blood cell count. Chemotherapy that induces this side effect is called myelosuppressive because it hinders the production of white blood cells. A low number of certain white blood cells called neutrophils, can put patients in risk and may result in the interruption of the chemotherapy treatment. Having sufficient levels of white blood cells may enable doctors to administer treatment according to the treatment schedule. Neulasta is administered through an injection given per cycle of treatment and is usually given 24 hours after a patient starts chemotherapy.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Neulasta</h2> Pegfilgrastim</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Neulasta </strong></h2>
