Due partly to the risk of <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://nypress.com/opana-a-brief-history/">Opana</a> abuse</strong> as well as other <strong>Opana ER side effects</strong>, this drug is not to be used to treat pain on an “as needed” basis. Nor is <strong>Opana ER</strong> to be used to treat mild pain that may occur shortly after a surgery.</p><h2>How does <strong>Opana ER</strong> work?</h2><p><strong>Opana</strong> ER works as other opioid drugs do. It changes the way the body perceives pain by attaching to certain receptors and blocking the pain sensation from reaching the brain. This action is coupled with a feeling of euphoria that is similar to other opioid drugs like morphine.</p><h2><strong>Opana ER side effects</strong></h2><p>Opana ER carries with it the risk of addiction. <strong>Opana ER’s</strong> active ingredient is the opioid oxymorphone. The risk of <strong>Opana ER dependency</strong> and addiction should be taken into consideration by both the doctor prescribing the medication as well as the patient being treated with it.</p><p>If you begin to feel a dependence on <strong>Opana ER</strong> or any other substance, seek professional help and utilize addiction resources like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationaladdictionhotline.com/">National Addiction Hotline</a> at 1(866)-301-0367.</p><p>To read about other <strong>Opana ER side effects</strong> and adverse reactions that may affect you while being treated with this medication, see the “<strong>side effects</strong>” and “warnings” tab at the top of the page.</p><h2><strong>Opana ER dosage</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Opana ER</strong> comes as a tablet and should be swallowed whole on an empty stomach at least one to two hours before eating.</li><li>The use of alcohol is contraindicated in patients receiving treatment with Opana ER.</li><li><strong>Opana ER dosage</strong> is to be individualized for each patient and is dependent on the patient’s condition, medical history, as well as other factors a doctor will take into consideration when writing a prescription for Opana ER.</li><li>If you have any questions about <strong>Opana ER dosage</strong>, or about <strong>Opana ER dependency</strong> and <strong>side effects</strong>, be sure to speak to your doctor to receive clarification.</li></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Opana ER</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Opana ER</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic:<br/><ul><br/><li>oxymorphone hydrochloride</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Opana ER </strong></h2>
