This product is used for preventing pregnancy and may be kept in place for as long as 3 full years.</p><h2>How Does Implanon Work?</h2><p>After being implanted into the upper arm, Implanon <strong>releases a steady amount of etonogestrel</strong>, a hormone that blocks the function of the ovaries and inhibits the an egg from being produced during ovulation. This hormone also accounts for a thickening of the cervical mucus as well as the lining as the uterus. These methods<strong> prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg</strong> or being able to survive by attaching to the uterus wall.</p><p>Implanon should be used <strong>only</strong> by women who are <strong>18 or older</strong>.</p><h2>How to Use Implanon</h2><p>Patients must consult a doctor before receiving Implanon so that the implant may be given at a proper time (depending on if the patient is using another form of birth control).
