Seroquel can be used alone or in conjunction with other medications to treat symptoms of these disorders such as manic episodes, and to assist in the treatment of depression.<br/> As an atypical antipsychotic, Seroquel works by altering certain chemicals found in the brain in a way that is considered non-traditional in relation to other medications in its class. By blocking the receptors for certain neurotransmitters in the brain, Seroquel helps maintain the balance of the chemicals serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which affect mood.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Seroquel</h2> Quetiapine</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Seroquel </strong></h2>
