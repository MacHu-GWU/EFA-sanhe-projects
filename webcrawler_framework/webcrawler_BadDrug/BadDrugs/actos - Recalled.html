Many patients who had been on Avandia were switched to Actos believing it would be safer. Now, a study is showing it is not safer than Avandia. Those who have taken Actos and suffered a heart attack or other injury as the result of it deserve to be compensated.<h1><b>Serious side effects include:</b></h1><ul><li>weight gain, due to fluid retention or extra body fat</li><li>nausea, stomach pain, unexplained tiredness, loss of appetite, dark urine, or <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/jaundice/article_em.htm">jaundice</a> that can signify liver problems</li><li>changes in vision, that can be symptoms of a serious condition known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_edema">macular edema</a></li><li>fractures in the hands, upper arms, or feet, especially in women</li><li>low red blood cell count</li><li>low blood sugar</li><li>ovulation, which can increase the chance of pregnancy</li><li><strong>bladder cancer</strong>, which is characterized by blood or red coloration in your urine, an increased need to urinate, and pain while urinating</li></ul> Alert your doctor immediately if you experience any of these serious side effects, or if common side effects persist.<h2></h2><h2>Common side effects include:</h2><ul><li>cold-like symptoms</li><li>headache</li><li>sinus infection</li><li>muscle pain</li><li>sore throat</li></ul> &nbsp;</div><div class="v" id="tab2" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Warnings & Recalls for Actos </strong></h2><h1>Serious Warning</h1> In September 2011, the Food and Drug Administration launched an investigation after initial data from an ongoing 10-year study by <strong>Actos’s manufacturer</strong>, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, suggested that the drug might increase the risk of <strong>bladder cancer</strong>. A recent epidemiological study conducted by the French Medicines Agency, a national French insurer, also suggested a heightened risk of <strong>bladder cancer</strong> for <strong>Actos</strong> users. In June 2011, French regulators suspended distribution of <strong>Actos</strong>, and the FDA issued a <a title="Black Box Warning" href="http://bad-drug.net/">black box warning</a> for the drug.The results of both studies show that, although there was no increased risk of<strong> bladder cancer</strong> among <strong>Actos</strong> users overall, there was an increased risk of cancer in those who had used the drug the most. There was also an increased risk of <strong>bladder cancer</strong> among users who had been exposed to the highest cumulative dosage of the drug. The FDA advises that people currently taking <strong>Actos</strong> should continue doing so until instructed otherwise by their healthcare professional. Those who are concerned about the risk of <strong>bladder cancer</strong> should talk to their healthcare provider. If you have already experienced complications associated with <strong>Actos</strong>, be sure to <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">report your experiences</a> and fill out our contact form to the right to get in touch with <a title="Bad Drug Attorney" href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug-attorney">one of our Actos lawyers.</a><h1>Black Box Warning</h1> Some compounds found in <strong>Actos</strong> may cause or exacerbate <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/congestive_heart_failure/article.htm">congestive heart failure</a> in some patients. Patients should be closely monitored for any rapid weight gain or edema, as these can be signs of this serious condition. Patients who have a medical history of symptomatic heart failure, or who have suffered from Class III or IV heart failure, should not take <strong>Actos</strong>.<strong>Actos</strong> may also cause a rare but serious side effect known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis">lactic acidosis</a> which is characterized by malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and abdominal pain. If you or someone you know suffer from these side effects while taking <strong>Actos</strong>, stop taking this medication and seek emergency medical attention immediately.Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding should exercise caution when using <strong>Actos</strong>, as there have been no established or well-controlled studies to examine the potential side effects this drug may have on unformed fetuses or nursing infants.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Actos Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img src="data:image/webp;base64,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" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Actos" title="Actos" pagespeed_url_hash="636655589" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></div><p><strong>Actos | Pioglitazone</strong> is part of the class of drugs known as <a target="_blank" href="http://diabetes.webmd.com/thiazolidinediones-for-type-2-diabetes">thiazolidinediones</a> and is manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals as an oral tablet. <strong>Actos</strong> is designed to heighten the body’s sensitivity to insulin and, along with diet and exercise, control <strong>blood sugar</strong> levels.</p><p><strong>Actos</strong> is indicated for the treatment of<strong> type 2 (or adult onset) diabetes. </strong>Actos is not for patients with type I (or “juvenile”) diabetes.</p><h2>Actos Dosage</h2><p>The recommended starting doses for Actos is as follows:</p><ul><li>15 mg or 30 mg once daily in patients without congestive heart failure.</li><li>15 mg once daily in patients with congestive heart failure.</li></ul><p>This dosage may be adjusted in increments of 15 mg over time, with a daily dosage not to exceed 45 mg once daily.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Actos</h2> Brand Name:<br/><ul><br/><li><strong>Actos</strong></li><br/></ul><br/> Generic (Unavailable):<br/><ul><br/><li>Pioglitazone hydrochloride</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Actos </strong></h2>
