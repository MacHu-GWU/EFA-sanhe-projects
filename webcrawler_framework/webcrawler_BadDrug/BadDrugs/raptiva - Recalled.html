Lymphocytes must bind to other cells through receptors on their surface in order to become functional and activated. The synthetic antibody (blood protein) Raptiva will prevent adhesion to a specific receptor and therefore prevent the unwanted activity of lymphocytes.</p><h2>Dosage information for Raptiva</h2><p>Raptiva is typically administered by a healthcare professional but some patients may choose to self-inject.</p><p>The recommended dose is a 0.7 mg/kg one-time conditioning dose that is proceeded by weekly doses of 1 mg/kg. It is recommended that a single dose not exceed a total of 200 mg.</p><p>Injections should be made in the thigh, abdomen, buttocks or upper arm and should be rotated with every use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Raptiva</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Raptiva</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Efalizumab</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Raptiva </strong></h2>
