Some patients who have received rubidium Rb 82 injections have had unintended exposure to strontium radiation where generator eluate testing appeared insufficient.</div><div class="v" id="tab2" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Warnings & Recalls for CardioGen-82 </strong></h2><h1>Warnings</h1> <br> Caution should be exercised during infusion on patients with congestive heart failure because they may experience a transitory increase in circulatory volume load. Strict adherence to a daily eluate testing protocol is required to minimize the risk of unintended radiation exposure. <br> <br><h2><strong>Family planning</strong></h2> <br> The FDA issued this drug a <strong>pregnancy category C</strong>. Patients should be advised to inform their physician or healthcare provider if they are<strong> pregnant</strong> or <strong>breast feeding</strong>, as <strong>radiation exposure</strong> may cause extreme <strong>harm to the fetus.</strong> <br> <br> Also it isn't known if rubidium Rb 82 is excreted in breast-milk and due to the short half-life of the drug it is unlikely. Patients who are breastfeeding should still <strong>exercise caution</strong> when rubidium Rb 82 is administered.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> CardioGen-82 Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/84x84xCardioGen-82-84x84.jpg,q1df917.pagespeed.ic.K3VYm9UL1k.jpg" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="CardioGen-82" title="CardioGen-82"/></div><h2><strong>What is CardioGen-82?</strong></h2><p><strong>CardioGen-82 </strong>is a radionuclide generator that produces an Rb-82 chlorine injection.Â <strong>Cardiogen-82</strong> should only be used with an infusion system specifically designed for the use with the generator and capable of accurate measurement and delivery of doses of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection.</p><h2>How does CardioGen-82 work?</h2><p>The Rb-82 <strong>emits radiation</strong> detected in a PET scan of the myocardial perfusion in adult patients with suspected or existing coronary artery diseases.</p><h2><strong>Dosage information</strong></h2><p>It&#8217;s recommended to use a single adult dosage of rubidium Rb 82 chloride injection is 1480 MBq (40 mCi) with a range of 1110-222- MBq (20-60 mCi). Do not exceed a single dose of 2220 MBq (60 mCi) and use the lowest dose necessary to obtain adequate cardiac visualization consistent with the dosing goal of as low as reasonably achievable.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for CardioGen-82</h2> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/> <br/> Rubidium chloride Rb-82</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for CardioGen-82 </strong></h2>
