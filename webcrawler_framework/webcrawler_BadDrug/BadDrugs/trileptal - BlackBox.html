The pharmacological activity of the main ingredient for this drug, Oxcarbazepine, occurs primarily through a metabolite called MHD, or 10-monohydroxy metabolite. In studies that have taken place, MHD-induced blockage of certain sodium channels results in the relaxation of hyper-excited neuronal membranes, the diminishing of synaptic impulses and inhibition of the repetition of neuronal discharges.</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>In a therapeutic setting for epilepsy, <strong>Trileptal</strong><strong>｜Oxcarbazepine</strong> is administered 300mg orally twice a day and the dosage is increased by the 3<sup>rd</sup> day to 1200mg.  In monotherapy, the dosage can be up to 600mg per day which can be increased to 2400mg per day within 2-4 weeks of starting the regimen while gradually reducing the dosage of other drugs used concurrently with <strong>Trileptal</strong><strong>｜Oxcarbazepine</strong>.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Trileptal</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Trileptal</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Oxcarbazepine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Trileptal </strong></h2>
