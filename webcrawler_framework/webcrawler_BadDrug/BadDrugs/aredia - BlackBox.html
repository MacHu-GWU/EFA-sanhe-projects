In the body, cells called <strong>osteoclasts</strong> create new bone and remove old bone in the body.

This prohibits from bones from being further damaged and allows the remaining bone to <strong>strengthen</strong>.</p><h2>Aredia Dosage Information</h2><p><strong>Aredia</strong> is a <strong>specialty pharmaceutical</strong> injected into the vein by a doctor or nurse at a clinic or hospital.
