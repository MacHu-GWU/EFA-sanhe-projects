This includes infections within the ear, urinary tract, and intestines. It can also be used as a treatment for <strong>pneumonia</strong> and <strong>Traveler&#8217;s Diarrhea</strong>, which is often caused b consuming contaminated food or liquids abroad. Cotrim will not help against viral infections such as the common cold or the flu.</p><h2>How does Cotrim work?</h2><p>Cotrim is an antibiotic that kills off bacteria by starving them of the acids and enzymes they need to replicate. This stops infections from spreading and doing more damage to the effected systems of the body.</p><h2>Cotrim Dosage Information</h2><p>Cotrim is typically taken twice daily for most infections. However, your doctor may increase your dosage depending on the severity of your infection. To decrease the effects of an upset stomach, take Cotrim with a full glass of liquid or a meal.</p><p>Even if your symptoms clear, you must take Cotrim for the entire time your doctor has prescribed Cotrim to you. Not completing a prescribed treatment may cause your infection to return.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Cotrim</h2> <strong>Brand names</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Cotrim</li><br/><li>Bactrim</li><br/><li>Septra</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li> sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Cotrim </strong></h2>
