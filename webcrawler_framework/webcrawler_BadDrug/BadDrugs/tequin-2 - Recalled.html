It is also prescribed for certain sexually transmitted diseases that are caused by bacteria. Tequin does not kill viruses, and thus, should not be taken for viral infections. It was approved for use in 1999. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Tequin&#8217;s manufacturer, subsequently pulled it off the market in 2006 because sources claimed that it caused <strong>severe blood sugar problems</strong> in patients. It is no longer available for purchase in the U.S.</p><h2 title=\"antibiotic\">How does Tequin work?</h2><p>Tequin treats infections such as <strong>pneumonia</strong> and <strong>bronchitis</strong> by stopping the growth of bacteria.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Ingest the 400 milligram Tequin tablet once daily (or as directed by your doctor) with a full glass of water. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids while on Tequin. You may take it with or without food. Try to take each dose at the same time every day. After taking Tequin, it is important to wait at least four hours before taking any drugs that contain magnesium or aluminum.</p><p>If you forget to ingest Tequin, take the missed dosage as soon as you can. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the previous one and take Tequin at your regularly scheduled time. Do not ingest extra tablets to make up for the one you missed.</p><p>Continue to take Tequin until the prescribed amount is fully gone, even if you start to feel better. Your symptoms may clear before the infection is completely treated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Tequin</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Tequin</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Gatifloxacin</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Tequin </strong></h2>
