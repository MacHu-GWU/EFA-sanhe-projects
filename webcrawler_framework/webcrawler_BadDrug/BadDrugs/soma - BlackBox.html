Soma is most effective when used during physical therapy or periods of rest or limited physical activity. This drug is manufactured and marketed in the U.S. by the company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.medapharma.us/">Meda Pharmaceuticals</a>.  <strong>Soma </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Carisoprodol</strong> is available by itself or can come mixed with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000802/">aspirin</a>, and in a particular combination with caffeine and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine">codeine</a> too.</p><h2><strong>How Does Soma Work?</strong></h2><p>Soma works to relax muscles by interfering with the reception of pain signals between the brain and nervous system. This prevents feelings of discomfort caused by injuries, and provides patients with relief.</p><h2>Soma Dosage Information</h2><p>The dosing for <strong>Soma </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Carisoprodol</strong> for adults and minors over the age of 16 is 250mg to 350mg orally 3 times in a day and once before going to bed. Soma should not be used for extended periods of time, and treatment is based on the patient&#8217;s response to the medication, as well as the condition the patient is being treated for.</p><p>Do not take Soma for longer than your doctor has suggested, and do not take more Soma than prescribed. These actions will not cause Soma to act more quickly or more powerfully, and will only increase the risk of potentially serious side effects.</p><h2>Adverse Side Effects</h2><p><strong>Soma </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Carisoprodol</strong> has associated adverse side effects that can be quite serious:</p><ul><li>Neurological side effects such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm">seizures</a></li><li>Psychiatric side effects such as drug abuse and dependency</li><li>Other side effects such as withdrawals</li></ul><h2>Contact Us</h2><p>If you or a loved one have experienced serious adverse side effects as a result of taking this drug, please do not hesitate to <a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">contact someone who can help you</a>.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Soma</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Soma</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Carisoprodol</li><br/></ul><br/><h2></h2></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Soma </strong></h2>
