Problems begin to surface when there is too much prolactin in the human body. In female patients, an excess amount of this hormone may result in absent menstruation, which can make it difficult, even impossible, for pregnancy to occur. In males, excess prolactin causes enlarged breasts and decreased sexual desire, as well as erectile dysfunction.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>The initial dosage for Dostinex is 0.5 milligrams per week. Tablets are administered orally and may be taken with or without food. Your doctor may decide to increase the dosage weekly or monthly.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Dostinex</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Dostinex</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Cabergoline</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Dostinex </strong></h2>
