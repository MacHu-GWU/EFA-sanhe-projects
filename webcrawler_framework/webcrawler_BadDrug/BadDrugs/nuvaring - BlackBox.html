NuvaRing was approved by the <strong>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</strong> in October of 2001. Since then, NuvaRing has become a controversial form of birth control because of the risks for developing <strong>serious health conditions </strong>while using this product.</p><p>NuvaRing is <strong>not</strong> a prevention method for sexually transmitted diseases.</p><h2>How Does NuvaRing Work?</h2><p>NuvaRing <strong>prevents pregnancy</strong> through several methods. First, NuvaRing excretes estradiol and etonogestrel to keep the ovaries from releasing an egg (<strong>ovulating</strong>). NuvaRing also causes the cervical mucus to <strong>thicken</strong> and <strong>alters the lining</strong> of the uterus, reducing the possibility of sperm to travel to the uterus and making it difficult for a possibly fertilized egg to bind to the uterine wall.</p><h2>How to Use NuvaRing</h2><p>NuvaRing comes in the form of a<strong> plastic ring</strong> to be placed in the vagina. Ask your doctor for proper instructions on how to correctly insert the ring. NuvaRing should be kept in the vagina for<strong> 21 days</strong>. After this period of time, NuvaRing should be removed for one week to allow for the start of your period. Continue with the cycle on the same day of the week that you started your use of NuvaRing. To prevent pregnancy, patients should use an <strong>additional</strong> form of birth control during the<strong> first week</strong> of starting use of NuvaRing.</p><p>NuvaRing should be left in the vagina during <strong>sexual intercourse</strong>. If you are experiencing discomfort, you may remove NuvaRing and rinse the ring with warm water. The ring <strong>should not</strong> be left outside the vagina for <strong>over 3 hours</strong>.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for NuvaRing</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>NuvaRing</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>ethinyl estradiol</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for NuvaRing </strong></h2>
