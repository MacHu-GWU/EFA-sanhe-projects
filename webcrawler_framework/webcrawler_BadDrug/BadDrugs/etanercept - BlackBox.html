It is a fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA. It is prescribed as primary treatment to reduce pain, swelling, and tenderness of joints resulting from moderate to <strong>severe heumatoid arthritis</strong> in adults. It may also be used when rheumatoid arthritis hasn&#8217;t responded well to other drugs.</p><h2><strong>How does Etanercept work?</strong></h2><p><strong>Etanercept</strong> also is used to reduce signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active, polyarticular-course, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-modifying drugs. It&#8217;s a TNF blocker that works by blocking the protein found in the body that causes inflammation.</p><h2><strong>Dosage information</strong></h2><p>Use the proper technique that your health care provider will teach you which is to inject deep under the skin and <strong>NOT</strong> into the muscle. Make sure to rotate the site of the injection and not to inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard. Make sure to avoid areas that have stretch marks and scars. Try not to inject directly into any raised, red, thick, or scaly skin patches if you have psoriasis.</p><p>Do NOT skip any dosages. If you miss one contact your doctor right away to find out when to take the next dose. Contact your health care provider if you have any questions about how to use etanercept.</p><p>Injections come in 25 mg solutions, 50 mg solutsions and lyophilized powder for a solution of 25 mg.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Etanercept</h2> <strong>Brand Name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Enbrel</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Etanercept </strong></h2>
