<h1 itemprop="aspect"> <strong>Drug-Coated Stents Side Effects</strong></h1> <strong>Drug-coated stents</strong> may cause <strong>uncommon serious, adverse </strong><strong>reactions</strong>. If you have any of the following symptoms, immediately contact your healthcare provider or doctor:<ul><li> Chest pain, sweating, drowsiness or dizziness which may be indicators of a <strong>heart attack</strong>.  Since stents alter the blood flow through the arteries, this is a possible side-effect that may be caused by irregular heart beats after the surgery</li><li><strong>Blood vessel damage</strong> caused by the stent which can lead to a heart attack or <strong>stroke</strong>. Patients suffering from this may require bypass surgery</li><li>Allergic reactions such as bodily swelling, trouble breathing, or chest pain. If these symptoms persist, the stent must be removed</li><li><strong>Thrombosis or blood clots</strong> which may decrease the blood flow to vital organs and may also lead to a heart attack or stroke</li></ul> Potential side effects following the procedure of a drug-coated stent may include the following. Although more <strong>common</strong>, if these symptoms persist for longer than several days or if there is an increase in severity, it is important to seek professional attention at once:<ul><li>Chest soreness and distress</li><li>Abnormal heart beat (Arrhythmia)</li></ul> &nbsp;</div><div class="v" id="tab2" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Warnings & Recalls for Drug-Coated Stents </strong></h2> In 2003, the <strong>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</strong> approved the first drug-coated stents for patients with clogged arteries. Researchers testify that drug-coated stents<strong> decrease the chances of retenosis</strong> or <strong>blood clotting</strong> by <strong>50%</strong> after the procedure, an area where bare-metal stents remain a risk to patients.However, patients with <strong>drug-coated stents</strong> are advised to continue usage of medication prescribed by their doctor. According to analysts, approximately <strong>29%</strong> of patients who terminated their use of medicine earlier than advised developed <strong>blood clots</strong>.Drug-coated stents <strong>should not</strong> be used for off-label purpose or reasons not approved by the FDA. The most common off-label purpose is decreasing short-term difficulties of stenting in <strong>saphenous vein grafts</strong> where treatment has shown significant reduction in the number of patients needed follow-up surgery after a year. Although approximately 60% of patients receive a stent for unapproved reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not sufficiently examined these uses to advise patients to undergo the procedure.Patients who are allergic to the following <strong>should not</strong> use a drug-coated stent:<ul><li>Zotarolimus</li><li>Cobalt</li><li>Nickel</li><li>Chromium</li><li>Molybdenum</li><li>Blood thinners</li></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Drug-Coated Stents Treatment and Use </strong></h2><p><strong>Drug-Coated</strong> <strong>Stents</strong>|<strong> </strong>Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) are peripheral or coronary stents placed in patients to treat <strong>peripheral or coronary artery blockages</strong> or <strong>retenosis</strong>. Doctors implement drug-coated stents as modern alternatives to bare-metal stents (BMS) which in recent studies were shown to have more occurrences of major <strong>adverse cardiac incidents</strong> including re-narrowing of the artery.</p><p>Stents are utilized to prevent and treat a buildup of artery clogging chemicals such as:</p><ul><li>Calcium</li><li>Lipids or fats</li><li>Cholesterol</li></ul><h2>How Do Drug-Coated Stents Work?</h2><p>During an angioplasty procedure, a drug-coated stent may be placed by doctors within a diseased, clogged peripheral or coronary artery. The stent opens the blockage, then releases a drug which stops cell production that may further obstruct the passageway of the artery causing<strong> fibrosis</strong> which may lead to <strong>retenosis</strong>. This method opens and unblocks the passageway of the artery, allowing for a more regular circulation of blood throughout the body as well as allowing any tears in the artery to heal.</p><div id="attachment_1267" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blockage.jpg?1df917"><img class="size-full wp-image-1267 " title="blockage" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/blockage.jpg?1df917" alt="blockage Drug Coated Stents" width="150" height="144" pagespeed_url_hash="3854259902" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blockage in artery before stent.</p></div><div id="attachment_1268" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/stent.jpg?1df917"><img class="size-full wp-image-1268 " title="stent" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/stent.jpg?1df917" alt="stent Drug Coated Stents" width="150" height="144" pagespeed_url_hash="2058139810" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Artery opening after stent.</p></div><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><h2></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How are Drug-Coated Stents Implemented and Maintained?</h2><p><strong>Drug-coated stents</strong> may be surgically placed in the artery by an Interventional cardiologist or an Interventional radiologist. The stent, shaped as a circular metal cage, expands once positioned in the artery and opens the passageway. This procedure typically takes between 30 minutes and an hour to perform.</p><p>After the process is complete, the stent is left in the artery. To ensure prevention of buildup around the stent, patients may be asked to use a combination the following medications to make platelets less productive:</p><ul><li>Soluble Aspirin or Bayer Aspirin, which is to be used indefinitely so long as the patient is not allergic to the medicine</li><li>Plavix, which is used for 4-6 weeks after the surgery when natural tissue will have completely covered the stent</li></ul><p>Your doctor may advise you to take <strong>blood-thinners</strong> for about a year after surgery for optimal results in preventing clots.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Drug-Coated Stents</h2> Coronary and peripheral stents come in the forms of:<br/><ul><br/><li>Drug-coated stents or drug-eluting stents (DES)</li><br/><li>Bare-metal stents (BMS)</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Drug-Coated Stents </strong></h2>
