Hereditary angioedema is an immune system disorder that causes intense swelling and pain in the body&#8217;s mucus and internal skin tissues. Some cases of angioedema become dire medical emergencies because they lead to airway obstruction or suffocation. Firazyr is marketed by Shire and was approved for use by the FDA in 2011.</p><h2>How does Firazyr work?</h2><p>Firazyr works by blocking proteins in the body called <a target="_blank" title="bradykinin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradykinin" target="_blank">bradykinin</a>. Patients with hereditary angioedema have excess amounts of bradykinin. This allows water and other bodily fluids to leak into areas where they should not and cause inflammation.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Each carton of Firazyr comes with a pre-filled 30 milligram syringe and a needle. A medical professional will tell you how to use Firazyr after it has been prescribed to you. Patients are advised to carry Firazyr on their person and administer it when they first notice symptoms of angioedema. The dosage instructions for Firazyr are below. If your symptoms persist, you may inject an additional dose of Firazyr after six hours, but do not use Firazyr more than three times in a 24-hour period.
