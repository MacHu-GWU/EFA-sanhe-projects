It treats <strong>seasonal</strong> (outdoor) and <strong>year-round</strong> (indoor) <strong>allergies</strong> and their symptoms, such as <strong>nasal congestion</strong>, <strong>sneezing</strong>, and <strong>itching</strong>. Nasonex is also prescribed to cure <a target="_blank" title="nasal polyps" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp" target="_blank"><strong>nasal polyps</strong></a> in adults ages 18 and older. It is marketed by Merck and was approved for use by the FDA in 1997.</p><h2>How does Nasonex work?</h2><p>Nasonex works by reducing swelling in the nasal passages.</p><h2><strong>Dosage</strong></h2><p>Nasonex is a topical spray that is inhaled by patients. To use Nasonex, follow these instructions:</p><ol><li>Shake the applicator before each use.</li><li>Clear your nostrils by gently blowing into a sheet of tissue paper.</li><li>Use your index finger to close one nostril. Tilt your head slightly forward and insert the applicator into your other nostril.</li><li>Press down firmly on the shoulders of the applicator using the index finger and middle finger of your free hand. Support the base of the bottle with your thumb.</li><li>Breathe in the mist.</li></ol><p>Repeat this process with your other nostril and remember to put the cap back on the applicator once you are done. If you are using your Nasonex bottle for the first time, prime the pump by pressing down on the shoulders of the applicator until a fine mist appears.</p><p>Nasonex is usually applied onceÂ  per day in each nostril. Try to use it at the same time(s) every day. In order to prevent seasonal allergy symptoms, begin using your nasal spray two to four weeks before the start of pollen season. It may take up to two weeks for you to feel the full effect of Nasonex. You should continue to use it even if you feel well. If used regularly, your supply of Nasonex should last 30 days.</p><p>To clean the applicator, remove the Nasonex cap and pull gently upwards on the pump until it comes loose. Run the applicator under cold water and dry it with a clean towel before reattaching it to the bottle.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Nasonex</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Nasonex</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Mometasone furoate</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Nasonex </strong></h2>
