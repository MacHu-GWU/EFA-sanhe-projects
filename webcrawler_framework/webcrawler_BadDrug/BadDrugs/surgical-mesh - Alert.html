Some of these complications include death. In October 2008, the FDA began to study surgical mesh used transvaginally and its effects. It was during this study that the FDA reported 2,900 injuries cause by transvaginal mesh.In January 2012, the FDA issued an order that required the producers of surgical mesh to study its risks when used transvaginally to treat urinary incontinence and is considering classifying surgical mesh used transvaginally as a high-risk device.The FDA suggests that patients who have pelvic organ prolapse repair with transvaginal mesh are exposed to more risks when compared to patients who have pelvic organ prolapse repair with only stitches, and the use of surgical mesh for repair is not any more effective than a non-mesh repair.For more information click <a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm142636.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Surgical Mesh Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/surgical-mesh-84x84.gif?1df917" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Surgical Mesh" title="Surgical Mesh" pagespeed_url_hash="711221167" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></div><h2>What is surgical mesh?</h2><p>Surgical mesh is a net-like, woven material made mostly from cloth, Gore-Tex, Teflon, polypropylene, or, in some cases, titanium. Mesh size, shape, and thickness can vary. Surgical mesh is used to:</p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">treat major wounds</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">strengthen and support internal tissues and organs</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">hernia repair and organ reconstruction</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Surgical mesh may also be used to treat </span><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">pelvic organ prolapse</strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> (where the bladder, uterus, bowel, or rectum is moved downward into the vagina from its original position due to weakened pelvic muscles) and </span><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">urinary incontinence</strong><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> in women by inserting the mesh transvaginally.</span></p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>Surgical mesh is attached to damaged tissue with the intent that the lattice structure will provide a  foundation for the growth of the tissue throughout the mesh so it can become unified with the body.</p><p>In <strong>pelvic organ prolapse</strong>, the mesh acts as a sling or hammock between the vaginal wall and the organs that have fallen out of place. In female urinary incontinence, surgical mesh is also used as a sling that is placed under the urethra and bladder and fastened to keep them closed during everyday activities to prevent leakage.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Surgical Mesh</h2></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Surgical Mesh </strong></h2>
