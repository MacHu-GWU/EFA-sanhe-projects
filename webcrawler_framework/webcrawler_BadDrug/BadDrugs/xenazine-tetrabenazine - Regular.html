For these reasons Xenazine must be slowly introduced to the patient through titration to see what level of dosage the patient can tolerate without experiencing adverse effects.</div><div class="v" id="tab3" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Xenazine Treatment and Use </strong></h2><div class="thumbnail-div"> <img width="84" height="84" src="http://www.bad-drug.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/84x84xXenazine-84x84.jpg,q1df917.pagespeed.ic.tWpSiTBvux.jpg" class="attachment-84x84 wp-post-image" alt="Xenazine" title="Xenazine"/></div><p>Xenazine | tetrabenazine is a medication that is used to treat chorea, or uncontrolled muscle movements, in patients who suffer from Huntington&#8217;s disease.  Xenazine works by reducing a certain chemical in the brain known as dopamine which helps control body movements. Although Xenazine&#8217;s success rate with the treatment of chorea is considerably high, it is not a cure for Huntington&#8217;s chorea, and should not be used for the treatment of other symptoms of Huntington&#8217;s disease.</p><h1>Xenazine Dosage</h1><p>Xenazine is an oral tablet which can taken with or without food. It comes in two different dosages- 12.5 and 25 milligram tablets. Your doctor will most likely start you on the lowest dosage possible, and then slowly increase it through a process known as titration. This will help to prevent serious side effects such as increased depression or suicidal thoughts. These side effects have resulted in the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration labeling Xenazine with a boxed warning, which is the most serious warning that can be applied to a medication. This warning is meant to emphasize important side effects that simply cannot be ignored.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has taken Xenazine and has suffered serious side effects as a result, <a title="report your experience" href="http://www.bad-drug.net/report-a-bad-drug">report your experience </a>so that you can share the potential dangers with others.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Xenazine</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Xenazine</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic:<br/><ul><br/><li>tetrabenazine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Xenazine </strong></h2>
