that is prescribed for the treatment of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" title="HIV" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV">HIV</a></span>.  Its drug classification is that of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" title="Reverse transcriptase inhibitor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase_inhibitor">nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor</a></span> (NARTI).  <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> is used in combination with other <a target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/treatment/en/">antiretroviral</a> drugs to treat HIV patients with or without the <a target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/infectious/aids.htm">AIDS virus</a>.  <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> doesn’t cure AIDS or HIV in the body but helps to slow the spread of it.  <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> also doesn’t prevent the spread of HIV or AIDS to other people.</p><h2>History Of The Drug</h2><p><strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> was synthesized in the 1960s by a scientist named Jerome Horwitz.  It had then been reconsidered as an anti-HIV and AIDS agent by the Rega Institute for Medical Research which is located in Belgium.  <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> had been approved by the FDA on June of 1994 for adults with HIV and AIDS and then in September of 1996, <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> had been approved for pediatric use.  Since then there has been an extended-release version of this drug synthesized in 2001.  <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> is notable for being the fourth released antiretroviral drug on the market.</p><p>On <a target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/world_aids_20091130/en/index.html">November 30, 2009</a>, the WHO (<a target="_blank" title="World Health Organisation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation">World Health Organisation</a>) stated that, “[The WHO] recommends that countries phase out the use of [<strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong></strong><strong>Stavudine</strong>], or d4T, because of its long-term, irreversible side-effects.  [<strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong>] is still widely used in first-line therapy in developing countries due to its low cost and widespread availability.  Zidovudine (AZT) or Tenofovir (TDF) are recommended as less toxic and equally effective alternatives”.</p><p>See the “warnings and recalls” tab to get more information about the “black box” warning associated with this drug.</p><h2>How This Drug Works</h2><p><strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong>, which is a NARTI, inhibits HIV virus replication by competing with attributes of DNA that spread HIV, and by the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by terminating chain elongation.  In addition to that, <strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> inhibits cellular DNA polymerases beta and gamma, and reduces synthesis of mitochondrial DNA.  A concentration of this drug ranging from 0.009 to 4 micromoles is the usual dosage required for the inhibition of HIV replication 50% <em>in vitro</em>.</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p><strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> dosing is dependent upon the age of the patient as well as the severity with which AIDS or HIV has diminished their potential to fight the disease.</p><ul><li><strong>Zerit </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Stavudine</strong> for adults weighing less than 132 lbs., 30mg orally as
