This includes infections of the skin, bone, joints, central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and reproductive system. Examples of bacterial infections are pelvic inflammatory disease, t<strong>richomoniasis</strong>, and <strong>Amebiasis</strong>. It is also sometimes used to treat bacterial infections in dogs, cats, and fish.</p><h2>How does Flagyl work?</h2><p>Flagyl is absorbed by bacteria and protozoa and inhibits further production by deactivating enzymes within them. With enough treatment, this clears the body of bacterial infection. Flagyl will not  work against viral infections such as the flu.</p><h2>Flagyl Dosage Information</h2><p>Flagyl comes in either a 250-mg or 500-mg tablet to be taken orally between one to three times a daily. Do not double a dose to make up for a missed dose. Taking this medication with a meal or a full glass of water or milk can prevent your stomach from becoming upset.</p><p>Treatments are typically between one and ten days depending on the type of infection, but can be extended by your doctor as needed. Bone, joint, and lower respiratory tract infections can sometimes require longer treatments. Keep taking Flagyl even if your symptoms improve. Stopping a treatment before the recommended time can cause a relapse of the infection.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Flagyl</h2> <strong>Brand name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Flagyl</li><br/><li>Metryl</li><br/><li>Protostat</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Metronidazole</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Flagyl </strong></h2>
