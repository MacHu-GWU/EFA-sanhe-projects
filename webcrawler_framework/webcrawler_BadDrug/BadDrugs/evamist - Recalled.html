It is marketed by Ther-RX and was approved for use in 2007 by the FDA.</p><h2>How does Evamist work?</h2><p>Some women require prescription medication to cope with menopausal symptoms. During menopause, a woman&#8217;s body produces less of the vital hormones estrogen and progesterone. This deficiency leads to a variety of symptoms. Hormonal therapy in the form of Evamist, which is absorbed through the skin, helps replace those lost hormones.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p>Evamist is applied to the epidermis on the inside of the forearm, between the elbow and wrist. An Evamist applicator comes with 75 sprays. Patients may use Evamist up to three times daily. New users should start with the smallest possible dose and gradually increase the dosage if needed. In order to prevent smearing, wait at least two minutes before putting on clothes. Avoid washing for at least an hour after applying Evamist.</p><p>Patients should stop using Evamist once their moderate or severe hot flashes are under control.</p><p>Female patients who have not had a <a target="_blank" title="hysterectomy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysterectomy" target="_blank">hysterectomy</a>, or surgical removal of the uterus, may be prescribed <a target="_blank" title="progestin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestin" target="_blank">progestin</a> in addition to Evamist.
