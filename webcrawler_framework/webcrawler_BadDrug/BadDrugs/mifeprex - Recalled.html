It is usually prescribed with<a href="http://www.bad-drug.net/bad-drug/misoprostol" target="_blank"> Misoprostol</a> for greater efficacy.  Currently, Mifeprex is the only FDA approved fully legal drug on the market for abortion.  While Mifeprex was still in trials, it was referred to as RU-486.  During the U.S. trials, 92% of patients who took the drug had a complete abortion.  Mifeprex is manufactured in the U.S. by Danko Laboratories and was initially approved by the FDA in September of 2000.</p><h2>What does Mifeprex do?</h2><p>Mifeprex aids in the early abortion process.  It accomplishes this by interacting with progesterone receptor sites.</p><h2>Dosage</h2><p><strong>Mifeprex should only be administered by a medical professional in a hospital, medical office, or clinic in case emergency surgery is necessary.</strong>  The usual dosage is 3 visits during which the physician administers the drug and monitors the patient.  The first day, the patient signs a patient agreement and takes three 200 mg tablets of Mifeprex.  On the third day, the physician  may make the patient take 400 mcg of Misoprostol if needed.  14 days after the initial dose of Mifeprex, the patient must schedule a follow up during which the physician will assess the success of the abortion.  Mifeprex is available as a light yellow 200 mg tablet with &#8220;mf&#8221; printed on one side.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Mifeprex</h2><h2>Brand Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Mifeprex</li><br/></ul><br/><h2>Generic Name</h2><br/><ul><br/><li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Mifepristone </span></li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Mifeprex </strong></h2>
