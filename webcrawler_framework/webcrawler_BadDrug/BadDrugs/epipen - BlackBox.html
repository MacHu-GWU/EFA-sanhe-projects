Anaphylaxis has many causes, such as allergies to food, bug bites, latex, and even exercise. <strong>Symptoms of anaphylaxis</strong> range from facial or oral swelling, to hives, difficulty breathing, obstruction of the airway, chest pain, and dizziness.</p><h2>How does Epipen work?</h2><p>During an allergic reaction, the body attacks what it perceives to be a harmful substance that is invading the body, releasing histamine in the process. In the case of anaphylactic allergic reactions, substances such as histamine cause the body to react in a dangerous, potentially lethal. Epipen combats this issue by signalling blood vessels to constrict and relaxing muscles in the lungs. Â This works to not only improve a patient&#8217;s ability to breathe, but also works to increase heart rate and reverse the effects of anaphylaxis, such as swelling and hives.</p><h2>Dosing instructions for Epipen</h2><p>Epipen should be injected into the middle, outer thigh; it should never be injected into the buttocks or directly into the vein. The orange tip of the pen should never be covered or pressed down upon unless you are pressing it into the skin for injection. Patients who require an Epipen should carry one with them at all times.</p><p>After use, seek immediate medical attention as you may require further medical attention. Always inform the doctor if you have used your Epipen injection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Epipen</h2><h2><strong>Brand name:</strong></h2><br/><ul><br/><li>Epipen</li><br/></ul><br/><h2><strong>Generic name:</strong></h2><br/><ul><br/><li>epinephrine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Epipen </strong></h2>
