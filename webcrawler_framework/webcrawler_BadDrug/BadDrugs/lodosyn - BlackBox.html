On its own, Lodosyn has no effects on Parkinson&#8217;s symptoms and must be combined with Levodopa for adequate results.</p><h2>How does Lodosyn work?</h2><p>Lodosyn is an enzyme blocking compound that can reduce some side effects of Levodopa while enhancing its effects. In the bloodstream, Lodosyn prevents the body from breaking down Levodopa, allowing it to move away from the bloodstream where it can cause some minor side effects. This allows more Levodopa to enter the brain and do more effective work against symptoms of Parkinson&#8217;s.</p><h2>Lodosyn Dosage Information</h2><p>Dosage of Lodosyn is variable on your condition and any previous response to treatment. Together with Levodopa, Lodosyn should be taken orally with a full glass of water or food. To achieve the greatest benefit from this medication, you should take it regularly.</p><p>If you were taking Levodopa prior to taking Lodosyn, your doctor may decrease your dosage of Levodopa to lessen your risk of side effects from an increased level of <strong>dopamine</strong>. Your first dose of Lodosyn should be taken at least twelve hours after your last dose of Levodopa.</p><p>Do not stop Lodosyn treatment without talking to your doctor about a gradual decrease in dosage  first. This can make some symptoms worse.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Lodosyn</h2> <strong>Brand name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Lodosyn</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Carbidopa</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Lodosyn </strong></h2>
