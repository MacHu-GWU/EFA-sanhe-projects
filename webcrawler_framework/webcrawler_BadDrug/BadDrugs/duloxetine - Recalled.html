This drug <strong>prevents reuptake</strong> (process of the attachment and release of a neurotransmitter  from a receptor site) after the serotonin and epinephrine has been released, causing an increased effect of the chemicals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>Duloxetine is available in<strong> 20, 30 and 60 mg extended release capsules</strong> to be taken whole, either with or without food. Although dosages may vary, a physician will start the patient on a low dose and increase incrementally. Duloxetine can help the symptoms of the above complications, however<strong> it does not cure the conditions</strong>. It may take up to 4 weeks for Duloxetine to start working to its full potential.</p><p>Patients should continue taking the drug, even if they feel better, and should not stop taking the drug without consulting a physician as<strong> sudden discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms</strong>. This drug should be taken exactly as mandated by a physician, at the same time each day, without alterations by the patient.</p><p><strong>Depression and anxiety</strong> are usually treated with 20 or 30 mg twice, or 60 mg once a day, where patients can be started with a low dose such as 20-30 mg and increased to 60 mg as the patient needs.</p><p>Those with <strong>diabetic nerve pain, fibromyalgia and arthritis</strong> normally take 30-60 mg of Duloxetine, depending on how the patient reacts to the drug.</p><p>The dosages for these conditions <strong>should not exceed 120 mg per day</strong>, as no benefit with a higher dosage has been recognized.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Duloxetine</h2> Duloxetine is also known as<br/><ul><br/><li>Cymbalta</li><br/><li>Ariclaim</li><br/><li>Xeristar</li><br/><li>Yentreve</li><br/><li>Duzela</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Duloxetine </strong></h2>
