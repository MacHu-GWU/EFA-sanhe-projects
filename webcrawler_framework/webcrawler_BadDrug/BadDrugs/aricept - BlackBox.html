It is a centrally acting <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase_inhibitor">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</a>.</p><p>This drug has not been proven to actually alter or “cure” Alzheimer’s disease, though certain controlled studies have observed mildly better cognitive and/or behavioral changes with its use.</p><h2>How does Aricept work?</h2><p>Aricept stops the enzyme acetylcholinesterase from breaking down acetylcholine, a chemical that assists in memory, attention, reason, and language. It is believed that halting the breakdown of acetylcholine will allow more of it to remain in the brain and therefore slow the progression of memory decline and cognitive thinking that is associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s. This is presumed to allow those with the disease to perform everyday functions that get more difficult as Alzheimer’s progresses.</p><h2>Aricept dosing</h2><p>Aricept | donepezil either comes in tablet or orally disintegrating tablet form. It can be taken with or without food, once daily.</p><p>For the orally disintegrating version, let the tablet disintegrate on your tongue and swallow this with a glass of water.</p><p>Aricept’s starting dose is 5 mg per day. After 4-6 weeks, this dose can be increased to 10 mg per day.  For the first three months of treatment, Aricept should be given at 10 mg per day. The maximum dose recommended is 23 mg per day.</p><p>For questions about Aricept, please ask your doctor, nurse, or other healthcare provider. If you are a loved one caring for an elderly person with Alzheimer’s, and have questions about Aricept, please ask a qualified healthcare professional for any assistance you may need in administering Aricept.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Aricept</h2> Brand name:<br/><ul><br/><li>Aricept</li><br/></ul><br/> Generic:<br/><ul><br/><li>donepezil</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Aricept </strong></h2>
