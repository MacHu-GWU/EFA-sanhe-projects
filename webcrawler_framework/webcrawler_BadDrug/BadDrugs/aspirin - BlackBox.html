Aspirin is also used in<strong> preventing ischemic strokes</strong> in patients who have a history of this condition.</p><h2>How Does Aspirin Work?</h2><p>Asprin works to reduce fevers by <strong>interfering</strong> with the <strong>hypothalamus</strong> and keeping signals from causing the body&#8217;s temperature to elevate. To alleviate pain, Aspirin prevents the production of <strong>prostaglandin</strong> and <strong>blocks signals</strong> of pain from reaching the brain. In this way, the body&#8217;s perception of pain is altered and the feeling of pain is reduced.</p><p>Aspirin prevents strokes and heart attacks by stopping the production of <strong>thromboxane</strong> which is responsible for causing platelets in the blood to stick to one another. This <strong>prevents clotting</strong> and blockage of arteries.</p><h2>How to Take Aspirin</h2><p><strong>Aspirin</strong> comes in the form of extended-release tablets (for prescribed patients), tablets, oral suspension, enteric-coated, delayed-release tablet, powder, gum, and suppository (to be used rectally).
