Some Rotigotine products were taken off the market in the United States in 2008; however, Neupro was approved for use by the <strong>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</strong> in April of 2012. Neupro may be prescribed to improve the following:</p><ul><li>movement capabilities</li><li>muscle function and control</li><li>the ability to balance</li></ul><div>Neupro may also be prescribed to treat and reduce the effects of moderate to severe <strong>restless legs syndrome</strong> (RLS).</div><div></div><div>Neupro is <strong>not a cure</strong> for Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</div><h2>How Does Neupro Work?</h2><p><strong>Dopamine</strong> is a chemical that is responsible for maintaining and <strong>controlling muscle movement</strong>. In Parkinson&#8217;s disease, dopamine levels may be decreased because nerve cells are no longer able to produce this substance. Neupro works by releasing and increasing the levels of <strong>dopamine-like chemicals</strong> in the brain. Neupro <strong>reduces</strong> shaking, muscle tension, trouble balancing and uncontrolled movements caused by this condition.</p><h2>How to Use Neupro</h2><p>Neupro comes in the form of a <strong>skin patch</strong>. Neupro is normally applied <strong>once</strong> each day. Be sure to apply the transdermal patch to an area that is dry and clean, and where the patch will not be rubbed off. It is recommended to apply Neupro to the abdomen, thigh, hip, side, upper arm or on the shoulder. The area should be shaved no less than three days before application. Be sure to press the patch firmly on the skin when applying to make sure that the edges stick to the body.</p><p><strong>Do not</strong> apply the patch to the same part of the skin for at least two weeks. <strong>Do not</strong> use patches that have been torn or cut.</p><p>Patients who are using Neupro should <strong>avoid direct sunlight</strong> and <strong>heat sources</strong> such as a sauna, hot tub, hot bath, or heating pads. This may cause an increase in release of chemicals in the patch.</p><p>Suddenly ending your use of Neupro after a long period of time may result in <strong>withdrawal symptoms</strong>. Do not stop using Neupro until your doctor instructs you to do so.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Neupro</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>Neupro</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>rotigotine</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Neupro </strong></h2>
