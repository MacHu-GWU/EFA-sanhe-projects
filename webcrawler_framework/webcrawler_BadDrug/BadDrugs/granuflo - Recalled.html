The product, manufactured by German company Fresenius Medical Care, contains acetate, which converts into bicarbonate in the body and if doctors do not monitor these levels closely the risks and <a href="http://dialysis-death.net/granuflo-cardiac-arrest/">side effects of GranuFlo</a> are dangerous, and sometimes lethal.Fresenius knew about the risks since last year, but failed to alert dialysis clinics nationwide about the issue. Instead, they chose to disclose the information solely to doctors at their Fresenius-owned dialysis clinics. The FDA is now investigating Fresenius for failure to warn the public of the serious risks associated with GranuFlo.Patients often suffer needlessly because of a corporation's negligence. If your loved one suffered injuries after dialysis you should contact an attorney to determine if GranuFlo was being administered incorrectly.

It is used to neutralize acid in the blood of patients undergoing dialysis.</p><h2>How does Granuflo work?</h2><p>Dialysis helps detox the blood of patients who have experienced kidney failure or impaired kidney function. Alkaline substances like Granuflo are used in dialysis to neutralize any acids that may build up in a patient&#8217;s blood.</p><h2>Granuflo Dosage Information</h2><p>Some of GranuFlo&#8217;s ingredients are converted into bicarbonates in the body, which means these levels must be monitored closely in patients, but many doctors were not accounting for these higher bicarbonate levels in patients. As a result, many people experienced metabolic alkalosis, which has serious and even lethal side effects.</p><p>Fresenius Medical Care runs hundreds of dialysis centers across the U.S. and the company circulated an internal notice to its FMC clinics about the issue in 2011. In the memo, the company cited that over 900 patients had suffered cardiac arrest in their FMC clinics and that alkalosis was a significant risk associated with cardiac arrest. Fresenius did not inform all other dialysis clinics using their product or the FDA about the <a target="_blank" href="http://dialysis-death.net/granuflo-cardiac-arrest/">risks of using GranuFlo improperly</a>. In June of 2012, the FDA issued a class 1 recall of GranuFlo after the memo was leaked to the federal agency.</p><h2>What if a loved one died after being given GranuFlo during dialysis?</h2><p>If your loved one suffered a cardiac arrest or died after being administered GranuFlo you should contact experienced legal counsel in order to investigate if improper use of GranuFlo was the cause.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Granuflo</h2><h1><strong>What is the generic name of GranuFlo?</strong></h1><br/> <strong>Brand name:</strong><br/><ul><br/><li>Granuflo</li><br/></ul><br/> Currently, there is no generic name brand of GranuFlo. The product was recalled by the FDA in June of 2012, but not all clinics have stopped using the product. There are few other brands of dialysis compounds to replace GranuFlo and for this reason clinics may still be using the product.<br/> <br/> Several lawsuits have already been filed after patients suffered cardiac arrests and died after undergoing hemodialysis treatments with GranuFlo. If your loved one suffered injuries or died after receiving treatment a a dialysis center you should contact an attorney to learn your rights and determine if GranuFlo was administered improperly.</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Granuflo </strong></h2><h2>Granuflo Lawsuit Updates</h2>
