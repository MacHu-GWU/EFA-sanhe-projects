When used in small doses this toxin <strong>paralyzes specific muscles</strong>, stopping them from contracting for months at a time. In larger amounts, this toxin causes <strong>botulism</strong>. Botox injections can be prescribed to treat several health problems, such as:</p><ul><li>Cervical dystonia, or <strong>painful muscle contractions</strong> in the neck</li><li>Eye conditions such as blepharospasm or strabismus</li><li>Urinary incontinence</li><li><strong>Muscle stiffness</strong> in the elbows, wrists, and fingers</li><li>Chronic migraines</li><li>Hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating</li></ul><p>It is also commonly used to temporarily correct cosmetic imperfections, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Furrows in the forehead</li><li>Crow&#8217;s feet</li><li>Frown lines</li></ul><h2>How Does Botox Work?</h2><p>Botox stops the release of acetylcholine, a chemical that activates muscle contractions. This causes paralyzation to treat tightness or spasms in targeted muscles.</p><p>Cosmetically, it reduces the visibility of facial wrinkles by paralyzing the muscles beneath them.</p><h2>How to take Botox</h2><p>Botox injections should only be administered in sterile environments, such as doctor&#8217;s offices or medical spas. NOT at nail salons and Botox parties.</p><p>No anesthesia is required when taking the shot. However, local anesthesia or numbing cream is sometimes used on the area of injection to reduce discomfort. Depending on the number of injection points, the procedure can take up to 20 minutes.</p><p>You may resume regular activity immediately after the injection. Do not rub the treated area to prevent to toxin from spreading to unwanted areas.</p><p>Results are not permanent, so follow-up injections should be scheduled every few months to maintain treatment.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Botox</h2> <strong>Brand name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>BOTOX</li><br/><li>BOTOX Cosmetic</li><br/></ul><br/> <strong>Generic name</strong>:<br/><ul><br/><li>OnabotulinumtoxinA</li><br/><li>Botulinum toxin type A</li><br/><li>BTA</li><br/><li>BoNT-A</li><br/></ul></div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Botox </strong></h2>
