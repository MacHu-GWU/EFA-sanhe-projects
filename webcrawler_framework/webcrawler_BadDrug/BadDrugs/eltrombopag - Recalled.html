This drug is for use after medications like corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and splenectomies have failed to relieve symptoms. Eltrombopag should not be used to normalize platelet counts but is only used in patients whose severe condition increases the risk of serious bleeding.</p><h2>How does Eltrombopag work?</h2><p>Eltrombopag contains eltrombopag olamine which works by reacting with the TPO receptor, thus causing bone marrow cells to produce more platelets. The medication controls the symptoms of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but does not cure it.</p><h2>Dosage Information</h2><p>Eltrombopag should be taken orally on an empty stomach, allowing 1 hour before a meal and 2 hours after a meal. Some medications and foods should be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after the patient takes Eltrombopag, these include antacids, calcium rich foods, iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium and zinc.</p><p>Eltrombopag dosage will be determined by a doctor but the patient will usually be started at the low dose of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, and be adjusted by a physician depending on the patient&#8217;s responses to the medication. Patients of Eastern Asian descent may be started at 12.5 mg per day. The maximum dose per day is 75 mg.</p><p>This medication should be taken at the same time every day. If a dose is missed, the patient should skip that dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Patient should only take 1 dose per day. Eltrombopag should not be suddenly discontinued as a physician will need to monitor the patient&#8217;s condition.</p><p>Platelet count will be checked at the start of medication, regularly throughout the treatment process and for at least 4 weeks after the treatment ends. Medications for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may also be prescribed alongside Eltrombopag.</p><p>Eletrombopag comes in 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg tablets.</p></div><div class="v" id="tab4" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> Other Names for Eltrombopag</h2> Promacta<br/> <br/> Revolade</div><div class="v" id="tab5" ><h2 itemprop="aspect"> <strong> Lawsuits & Legal Information for Eltrombopag </strong></h2>
