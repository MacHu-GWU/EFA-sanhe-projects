Fainting 

(Factors)
1. Blood Glucose:
Normal (while fasting): 70-100
Normal (no fasting): <125
Diabetic (before meal): 90-130
Diabetic (after meal): <180

- Low blood sugar levels are directly correlated with feeling faint or fainting. 
- Especially in diabetes patients.

2. Blood Pressure: Systolic / Diastolic
- Normal: 90-119 / 60-79
- Hypertensive: <90 / <60
- PreHypertensive: 120-139 / 80-89
- Stage 1 Hyp: 140-159 / 90-99
- Stage 2 Hyp: 160-179 / 100-109
Hyp Emergency: >180 / >110

Conditions  that can cause low blood pressure:
1. Pregnancy
2. Heart Problems
3. Endocrine problems - thyroid, diabetes
4. Dehydration
5. Blood loss
6. Severe infection
7. Allergic reactions
8. Lack of nutrients in your diet

- Blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply upon waking up. 
- only one of the two numbers has to be lower/ higher then the normal range for it to be considered as low / high. 
- a drop in as few as 20mm can cause dizziness & fainting 
- Athletes and people who exercise regularly tend to have lower blood pressure and a slower heart rate than do people who aren't as fit. 
- So do non-smokers and people who eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight.

3. Heart Rate:
- normal adult heart rate ranges from 60-100bpm
- fainting may occur if the heartbeat is <30 and >180 bpm. 
- patients with a past involving heart attacks or heart valve disease could be more at risk then usual. 
- faints occur from a rhythm problem - usually from stress

4. Oxygen Saturation:
- Average range from 99% - %96
- Should stay above %94 regularly (fluctuations of 3% are natural in sleep or relaxation)
- below %92 is considered unhealthy and dangerous

5. Temperature (body):
- average is %98.6
- fluctuates throughout the day by about .9% F

6. Weight (body)

Why Fainting  Occurs:
- decreased blood flow from the heart to the brain. 
- heart failure (pumping blood from the heart to the brain)
- blood vessels can't handle an increase in blood pressure
- not enough blood pumping through the vessels
-combo of the features above

* Heart rate changes are the most common cause of fainting * 
- a drop in heart rate is usually caused by a drop in blood pressure / or vice versa

Postural Hypertension - going from a relaxed state to an active state too quickly. 
-  loss of blood & water mix within the blood vessels

Vertebrobasilar artery disease (blood vessels thinning over time): increases with age in everyone anyway. 
- Can be increased faster by the following:
- smoking
- high blood pressure
- high cholesterol 
- diabetes

Other causes of fainting:
- Blood thinners
- High Cholerterol medicine
