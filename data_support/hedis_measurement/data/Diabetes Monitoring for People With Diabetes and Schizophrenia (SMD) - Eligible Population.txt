Step 1
Identify members with schizophrenia as those who met at least one of the following criteria during the measurement year:
•	At least one acute inpatient encounter, with any diagnosis of schizophrenia. Either of the following code combinations meet criteria:
–	BH Stand Alone Acute Inpatient Value Set with Schizophrenia Value Set.
–	BH Acute Inpatient Value Set with BH Acute Inpatient POS Value Set and Schizophrenia Value Set.
•	At least two visits in an outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, ED or nonacute inpatient setting, on different dates of service, with any diagnosis of schizophrenia. Any two of the following code combinations meet criteria:
–	BH Stand Alone Outpatient/PH/IOP Value Set with Schizophrenia Value Set.
–	BH Outpatient/PH/IOP Value Set with BH Outpatient/PH/IOP POS Value Set and Schizophrenia Value Set.
–	ED Value Set with Schizophrenia Value Set.
Step 2
Identify members from step 1 who also have diabetes. There are two ways to identify members with diabetes: by claim/encounter data and by pharmacy data. The organization must use both methods to identify the eligible population, but a member need only be identified by one to be included in the measure. Members may be identified as having diabetes during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year.
Claim/encounter data. Members who met any of the following criteria during the measurement year or the year prior to the measurement year (count services that occur over both years):
•	At least two outpatient visits (Outpatient Value Set), observation visits (Observation Value Set), ED visits (ED Value Set) or nonacute inpatient encounters (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set), on different dates of service, with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set). Visit type need not be the same for the two encounters.
•	At least one acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set), with a diagnosis of diabetes (Diabetes Value Set).
Pharmacy data. Members who were dispensed insulin or oral hypoglycemics/ antihyperglycemics on an ambulatory basis during the measurement year or year prior to the measurement year (Table CDC-A).
