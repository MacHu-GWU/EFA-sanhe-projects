Step 1
Identify all members who had an outpatient visit (Outpatient Value Set), an observation visit (Observation Value Set), an ED visit (ED Value Set) or an acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set), during the Intake Period, with any diagnosis of COPD (COPD Value Set), emphysema (Emphysema Value Set) or chronic bronchitis (Chronic Bronchitis Value Set). 
If the member had more than one eligible visit, include only the first visit. 
Step 2
Test for Negative Diagnosis History. Exclude members who had an outpatient visit (Outpatient Value Set), an observation visit (Observation Value Set), an ED visit (ED Value Set) or an acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set) during the 730 days (2 years) prior to the IESD, with a diagnosis of COPD (COPD Value Set), emphysema (Emphysema Value Set) or chronic bronchitis (Chronic Bronchitis Value Set). 
For an acute inpatient IESD, use the date of admission to determine the Negative Diagnosis History. 
Step 3
Calculate continuous enrollment. Members must be continuously enrolled in the organization 730 days (2 years) prior to the IESD through 180 days (6 months) after the IESD.
