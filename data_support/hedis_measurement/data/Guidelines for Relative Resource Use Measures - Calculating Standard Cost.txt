Step 1
Identify eligible members for each major clinical condition and assign them a risk group.
Step 2
Identify all services rendered during the treatment period for each service category:
•	Inpatient Facility (services provided by a facility during an inpatient stay).
•	E&M (inpatient visits, and outpatient visits including office visits, consultations and other services).
•	Surgery and Procedure (inpatient and outpatient procedures).
•	Diagnostic Imaging.
•	Diagnostic Laboratory. 
•	Pharmacy (ambulatory prescriptions).
Step 3
Multiply the standard price by the units of service to compute a standard cost for the service. Refer to each service category’s instructions (i.e., Calculating Total Standard Cost).
Step 4
For each major clinical condition, sum each member’s total standard cost for each service category. 
Step 5
Report the total standard cost by age, gender and risk group.
Step 6
In each service category, if a member’s standard cost exceeds the cap amount, report the total standard cost, including only the cap amount from Table SPT-CAP. Do not exclude members who exceed the cap.
