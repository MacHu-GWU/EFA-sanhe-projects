Step 1	Identify the member’s PCP.
If the member had more than one PCP for the time period, identify the PCP who most recently provided care to the member.
If the member did not visit a PCP for the time period or does not have a PCP, identify the practitioner who most recently provided care to the member.
If a practitioner other than the member’s PCP manages the hypertension, the organization may use the medical record of that practitioner.
Step 2	Use one medical record to both confirm the diagnosis for the denominator and identify the representative BP level for the numerator. There are circumstances in which the organization may need to go to a second medical record to either confirm the diagnosis or obtain the BP reading, as in the following two examples.
If a member sees one PCP during the denominator confirmation period (on or before June 30 of the measurement year) and another PCP after June 30, the diagnosis of hypertension and the BP reading may be identified through two different medical records.
If a member has the same PCP for the entire measurement year, but it is clear from claims or medical record data that a specialist (e.g., cardiologist) manages the member’s hypertension after June 30, the organization may use the PCP’s chart to confirm the diagnosis and use the specialist’s chart to obtain the BP reading. For example, if all recent claims coded with 401 came from the specialist, the organization may use this chart for the most recent BP reading. If the member did not have any visit with the specialist prior to June 30 of the measurement year, the organization must go to another medical record to confirm the diagnosis.
