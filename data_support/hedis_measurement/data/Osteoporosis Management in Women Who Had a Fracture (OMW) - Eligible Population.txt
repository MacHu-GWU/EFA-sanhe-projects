Step 1
Identify all members who had an outpatient visit (Outpatient Value Set), an observation visit (Observation Value Set), an ED visit (ED Value Set), a nonacute inpatient encounter (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set) or an acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set) for a fracture (Fractures Value Set) during the Intake Period. If the member had more than one fracture, include only the first fracture. 
Step 2
Test for Negative Diagnosis History. Exclude members with an outpatient visit (Outpatient Value Set), an observation visit (Observation Value Set), an ED visit (ED Value Set), a nonacute inpatient encounter (Nonacute Inpatient Value Set) or an acute inpatient encounter (Acute Inpatient Value Set) for a fracture (Fractures Value Set) during the 60 days (2 months) prior to the IESD. 
For fractures requiring an inpatient stay, use the admission date to determine Negative Diagnosis History. 
For direct transfers, use the first admission to determine the Negative Diagnosis History. 
Step 3
Calculate continuous enrollment. Members must be continuously enrolled during the 12 months prior to the fracture through 180 days (6 months) post-fracture.
Step 4
Required exclusions	Exclude members who met any of the following criteria:
•	Members who had a BMD test (Bone Mineral Density Tests Value Set) during the 730 days (24 months) prior to the IESD. 
•	Members who had a claim/encounter for osteoporosis therapy (Osteoporosis Medications Value Set) during the 365 days (12 months) prior to the IESD.
•	Members who received a dispensed prescription or had an active prescription to treat osteoporosis (Table OMW-C) during the 365 days (12 months) prior to the IESD. 
For an inpatient encounter, use the admission date to determine the days  prior to the IESD.
