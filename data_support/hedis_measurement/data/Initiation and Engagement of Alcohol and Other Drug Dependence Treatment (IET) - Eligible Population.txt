Step 1 
Identify the Index Episode. Identify all members in the specified age range who during the Intake Period had one of the following:
•	An outpatient visit, intensive outpatient visit or partial hospitalization with a diagnosis of AOD. Any of the following code combinations meet criteria:
–	IET Stand Alone Visits Value Set with AOD Dependence Value Set.
–	IET Visits Group 1 Value Set with IET POS Group 1 Value Set and AOD Dependence Value Set.
–	IET Visits Group 2 Value Set with IET POS Group 2 Value Set and AOD Dependence Value Set.
•	A detoxification visit (Detoxification Value Set).
•	An ED visit (ED Value Set) with a diagnosis of AOD (AOD Dependence Value Set).
•	An inpatient discharge with a diagnosis of AOD as identified by either of the following:
–	An inpatient discharge with a diagnosis of AOD (AOD Dependence Value Set).
–	An inpatient discharge with an AOD procedure code (AOD Procedures Value Set).
For members with more than one episode of AOD, use the first episode. 
For members whose first episode was an ED visit that resulted in an inpatient event, use the inpatient discharge.
Select the IESD.
Step 2
Test for Negative Diagnosis History. Exclude members who had a claim/encounter with a diagnosis of AOD (AOD Dependence Value Set) during the 60 days (2 months) before the IESD. 
For an inpatient IESD, use the admission date to determine the Negative Diagnosis History. 
For an ED visit that results in an inpatient event, use the ED date of service to determine the Negative Diagnosis History.
Step 3
Calculate continuous enrollment. Members must be continuously enrolled for 60 days 
(2 months) before the IESD through 44 days after the IESD, with no gaps.
